shrewdly, that from all the parts of nature may be collected
various names of God, bnt yet that the one God is not therefore
divided ; (t) as if we were not already too much inclined ιο
vanity, without being further and mora violently seduced into
error, by the notion of such a various abundance of gods.
The mystical theology of the Egyptians also shows that they
all sedulously endeavoured to preserve the appearance of reason
in the midst of their folly. (o) And any thing apparently
probable might at first sight, perhaps, deceive the simple and
incautious; but there never was any human invention by
which religion was not baaely corrupted. And this confused
diversity imboldened the Epicureans, and other gross despisers
of piety, to reject all idea of God. For, seeing the wisest of
men contending with each other for contrary opinions, they
hesitated not, from their dissensione, and from the frivolous
and absurd doctrines maintained by tlte different parties, to
infer, that it was vain and foolish for mon to torment thern·
selves with investigations concerning God, who does not exist.
And this they thought they might do with impunity, supposing
that a compendious denial of any God at all would be better
than feigning uncertain gods, and thereby occasioning endless
controversies They reason very ignorantly, or rather en·
deavour to conceal their own impiety behind the ignorance
of men, which not at all justifies any encroachment on God.
But from the general confession, that there is no subject pro·
ductive of so many dissensions among the learned as well as
the unleamed, it is inferred, that the minds of men, which err
so much in investigations concerning God, are extremely blind
and stupid in celestial mysteries. Others commend the an·
swer of Simonides, (ro) who, being asked by Hiero the Tyrant
what God was, requested a day ιο consider it. When the
tyrant, the next day, repeated the inquiry, he begged to be
allowed two days longer; and, having often doubled the
number of days, at length answered, “The longer 1 consider
tlte subject, the more obscure it appears to me.” He pmdently
suspended his opinion on a subject so obscure ιο him; yet this
shows that men, who are taught only by nature, have no cer·
tain, sound, or distinct knowledge, but are confined to con·
fused principles; so that tlrey worship an unknown God.

Xlll. Now, it must also be maintained, that whoever adul·
terates the pure religion, (which must necessarily be the case
of all who are influenced by their own imagination,) he is
guilty of adeparture from tlte one God. They will profess,
indeed, a different intention ; but what they intend, or what
