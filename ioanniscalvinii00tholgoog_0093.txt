in which we have no mention of the sceptre in the tribe of
Judah. After the inauguration of Saul, the regal power
seemed to bo fixed in the tribe of Beniamin. When Samuel
anointed David, what reason appeared for transferring it?
Who would have expected a king to ariso out of the plebeian
family of a herdsman? And of seven brothers, who would
have conjectured that such an honour was destined for the
youngest? And by what means did he attain a hope of the
kingdom? Wbo can assert that this unction was directed by
