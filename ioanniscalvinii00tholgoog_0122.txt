he “ fell down '' before Peter, therefore, it cemainly was not
withan intentIonof worshipping him instead of God z (ι’) yet
Peter positively forbade him te dc it. And why was this,
but because meu never se particularly distinguish between tha
worship or homage of God, and that of the creaturas, as to
avoid transferring te a creature what belongs exclusively to
. God? Wherefore, if we desire to have but one God, let ua
remember, that his glory ought not, in the least, to be dimin·
ished; but that he must retain all that belongs to him.
Therefore Zechariah, when speaking of the restoration of the
›Church expressly declarasset only that “ there shall be one
Lord‚’' but also “that his name shall be one ς ” (lc) signifying,
without doubt, that he will have nothing in common with
idols. Now, what kind of worship God requires, will be
seen, in due course, in another place. For he hath been
pleased, in his lav, to prescribe to mankind 'what is lawful
and right ; aud so to confine them to acertain rulo, that every
individual might not take the liberty of inventiug a mode of
worship according to his own fancy. But, since it is not
proper to burden the temler, by coufoundiug many subjecta
together, I shall not enter on that point yet, let it suffice to
know, that no religious services can be transferred to any
other than God alone, without committing sacrilege. At first,
indeed, superstition ascribed Divina honours either to the sun,
or to the other stars, or to idols. Afterwards followed am·

bition, which, adorning men with the spoils of God, dared to ’

profane every thing that was sacred. And although there re·
maiued apersuasion, that they ought to worship a supreme
God, yet it became customary to offer sacrifices promiscuously
to genii, and inferior deities, and deceased heroes. So steep
is the descent to this vice, to communicate to a vast multitude

that which God particularly challenges to himself mone!
