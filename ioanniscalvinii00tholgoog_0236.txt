madest known unto our fathers thy holy sabbath, aud com·
maudedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of
Moses.” (t) We see the singular estimation in which it is
held above all the commandments of the law. All these
things tend to display the dignity of the mystery, which is
beautisnlly expressed by Moses and Ezekiel. ln Exodus we
read as follows: “ Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep; soritis a
sign between me and you throughout your generations; that
ye may know that lam the Lord that doth sanctisy you. Ye
shall keep the sabbath tlrercfore3 sor it is holy unto you. The
children of lsrael shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath
throughout their generations, sor a perpetual coveuant. It is a
sign between me and the children of lsrael sor ever.” (τ’) This
is more fully expressed by Ezekiel; but the substance os what
he says is, that the sabbath was a sign by which the Israelites
might know that God was their sanctifier. (lc) lf our sanctifi·
cation consists properlyin the mortification of our own will, there
is a very natural analogy between the external sign and the in·
temal thing which it represents. We must rest altogether, that
God may operate within us; we must recede from our own will,
resign our own heart, and renounce all our carnal affectious3 in
short, we must ccase from all the efforts os our own under·
standing, that having God operating within us, we may enjoy
rest in him, as we are also taught hythe Apostle. ( l)

XXX. This perpetual cessation was represented to the Jews
by the observance os one day in seven, which the Lord, in
order that it might be tlre more religiously kept, recommended
by his own example. For it is no small stimulus to any ac·
tion, sor a man to know that he is imitating his Creator. lf
any one inquire astera hidden signification in the septenary
number, it is probablc, that because in Scriptura it is the
number of perfectiori, it is here selected to deuote perpetual
duration. This is confirmed also by the circumstance, that
Moses, with that day in which he narratas that the Lord tested
from his works, concludes his description os the succession of
days and nights. We may also adduce anot'lrer probable eon·
jecture respecting this number-that the Lord intended to
signify that the sabbath would never be completed until the
arrival of the last day. For in it we begin that blessed rest,
in which we make new advauces from day to day. But be·
cause we are still engaged iu a perpetual warfare with the
flesh, it will nothe consummated before the completion of that
prediction of lsaiah, “It shall come to pass, that from one new
moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all
