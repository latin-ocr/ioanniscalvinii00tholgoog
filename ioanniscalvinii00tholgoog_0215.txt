what intention every act has been performed 3 but do not scru-
tinize the secret thoughts. Human laws therefore are satisfied,
when a man abstains from external transgression. But, on the
contrary, the Divine law being given to our mimis, the proper
regulation of them is the principal requisite to a righteous
observance of it.. But men in general, even while they reso·
lutely dissemble their contempt os the law, dispose their eyes,
their feet, their hands, and all the parts of their body, to some
kind of observance os it, while at the same time their hearts
are entirely alienated from all obedience to it, and they suppose
that they have discharged their duty, if they have conoealed
from man what they practise in the sight oi God 'I'hey hear
the commands, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit
adultery, Thou shalt not steal. They draw not the sword to
commit murder; they never associate with harlots3 they lay
no violent hands on the property of others. All these things
thus sar are well; but in their whole souls they breathe aster
murders, they kindle into lust, they look with dishonest eyes
on the property of others, and in their cupidity they devour it.
Now, then, they are destitute os the principal requisito os the
law. Whence arises such gross stupidity, but from discarding
the Legislator, and accommodating a righteousness to their own

affirma that “the law is spiritual;” (l) signiiying that it re·
quires not only the obedience os the soul, the understanding,
and the will, but even an angelic purity, which, being cleansed
fSrom all the pollution os the flesh, may savour entirely os the
pirit.

Vll. When we say that this is the sense of the law, we
are not introducing a novel interpretationes our own, but lol-
lowing Christ, who is the best interpreter ol it. Eor the people
having imbibed srom the Pharisees the corrupt opinion, that
he, who hos perpetrated no external actos disobedience to tho
law, isan observer os the law, he confutes this very dangerons
error, and pronounces an unchaste look at a woman to be
adultery3 he declares thern to be murderers, who hate a
brother; he makes them “in danger of the judgment,” who
have only conceived resentment in their hearts; them “in
danger of the council‚'’ who in murmuring or quarrelling have
discovered any sign of an angry mind; and them “ in danger
of hell fire,” who with opprobrious and slanderous language
have broken forth into open rage. (m) Persons who have not
perccived these things, have pretended that Christ was another
Moses, the giver of an evangelical law, which supplied the
deficiencies of the law of Moses. Whence that common max-
