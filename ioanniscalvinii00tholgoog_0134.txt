A cassatos of greater difficulty arises from other passages,
where God is said to incline or dratv, according to his own
placatura, Satan himself and all the reprobate. For the camal
understanding scarcely comprehends how he, acting by their
means, contracta no defilement from their criminality, aud,
even in operations common to himself and them, is frea from
every fault, and yet righteously condemns those whose ministry
heuses. Hence was iuvented the distinction between doing and
permitting ,· because to many persons this has appeared an in·
explicable difficulty, that Satan and all the impious are subject te
the power and govemment of God, so that hc directs their malice
to whatever end he pleases, and uses their crimes for the ex·
ecution of his judgments. The modesty of those who are
alarmed at the appearance of absurdity, might perhaps be ex·
cusable, ifthey did not attempt to vindicate the Divina justice
from all accusation by a pretence utterly destitute of any foun-
dation in truth. They consider it absurd that a'man should
be blinded by the will and command of God, and afterwards
be punished sor his bliudness. They therefore evade the dif-
ficulty, by alleging that it happens only by the permission, and
not by the will of God; but God himself, by the most un·
equivocal declarations, rejects this subterfuge. That men,
however, can effect nothmg but by the secret will of Ged, and
ean deliberate on nothing but what he has previously decreed,
aud determines by his secret direction, is proved by express
and innumerable testimonies What we have before cited
from the Psalmist‚ that “God hath done whatsoever he hath

mmcd, and that without any exception, who will venture to
assert, that he remains ignorant and unconeemed respectiug
men, while they are actuated by the blmd influence of chance?
But this subject will be better elucidated by particular ex·
amplas. From the first chapter of Job we know that Satan
presents himself before God to receive his commanda, as well
as the angela, who yield a spontaneous obedience. Itis, indeed,
