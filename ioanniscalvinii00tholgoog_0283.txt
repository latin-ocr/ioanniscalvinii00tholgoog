men τ (o) he could not have been our righteousness, because he
was made a sacrifice for us, that Cod might not impute sins to
us. (p) Finally‚ he would have been despoiled of all the noble
characters under which he is celebrated in the Scriptura.
This assertiones Paul would have no foundation: “What the
law could not do, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of
sinful dash, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.'' (q) Nor
would there be any truth in what he teaches in another place,
that “ the kindness and love of God our Saviour towards man
appeared” (r) in the gift of Christ asa Redcemer. To cou-
clude, the Scripture no where assigns any other end, for which
the Son of God should choose to become incarnata, and should
also receive this command from the Father, than that he might
be made a sacrifice to appense the Father on our account.
“ Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer;
and that repentance should be preaohed in his name.”(s)

“ Therefore doth my Father love me, because l lay down my ·

life. This commandment have 1 received of my Father.’' (t)
“As Moses lifted up the serpent in tha wildcmess, even so
must the Son of man be lifted up.’' (u) Again: “ Father, save
me from this hour; but for this cause came l unto this
hour.”(w) “ Father, glorify thy Son.’‘ (a) Where he clearly
assigna, as the end of his assumption of human nature, that it
was to be an expiatory sacrifice for the abolition of sins. For
the same reason, Zacharias pronounces that ha is come, accord·
ing to the promise given to the fathers, “to give light to them
that sit in the shadow of death.” (y) Let us remember that
all these things are spoken of the Son of God, “in whom,”
according to the testimony of Paul, “are hidden all the trea-
sures of wisdom and knowledge,'' (z) and besides whom he
glories in knowing nothing. (a)

V. If any one object, that it is not evinccd by any of these
things, that the same Christ, who has redeemed men from con·
demnatiorr, could not have testified his love to them by assum·
ing their nature, if they had remained in a state of integrity
and safety,-we briefly reply, that since the Spirit declares
these two things, Christ's becoming our Redeemer, and his
participat ion of the same nature, to have been connected by
the eternal deoreg of God, it is not right to make any further
inquiry. For he who feels an eager desiret to know something
more, not being content with the immutable appointment of
God, shows himself also not to be contented with this Christ,
who has been given to us as the price of our redemption
