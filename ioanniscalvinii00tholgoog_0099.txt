whence we infer, that these persons are guilty of detestable
sacrilege, in disjoiniug these two things, which the prophet
hes connected in en iuviolable uuion. Agaiu; Paul, aster he
had been caught up into the third heaven, did not cease to
atudy the doctrine oi the law and the prophets; as he also
exhorted Timothy, e toacher of more thau common excellence,
to “give attendance to reading.” (o) And worthy os remem-
brauce is his eulogium ou the Scriptura, that it “is profitable
sor doctrine, for reprooi, for correction, sor instruction in right·
eousucss; that the man of God may be persect.'’ (p) How
diabolical, theu, is that madness which pretends that the use
of the Scripture is only transient and temporary, which guides
the sons oi God to the highest point oi perfectioni 1 would
also ask them another question -whether they have imbibed
a different spirit from that which the Lord promised to his
disciplesl Greut as their infatuatiou is, Ι do not think them
fanatice! enough to hazard such au avowal. But what kind
ot* Spirit did he promise? One, truly, who should “not
spealr os himself,” (q) but suggest and instil into their minds
those things which he had orally delivered. The office oi
the Spirit, theu, which is promised to us, is not to feigu new
end unheard of revelatione, or to coin a new system oi doctrine,
which· would seduce us from the received doctrine os the Goe-
pel, but to seal to our minds the saun doctrine which the
Gospel delivers.

ΙΙ. Hence we readily understand that itis incumbent ou us
diligently to read and attend to the Scripture, is we would re·
ceive any advantage or satisfaction irorn the Spirit os God;
(thus also Peter (r) commende those who studiously attended
to the doctrine of the prophete, which yet might be supposed
to have retired after the light oi the Gospel was risen 3) but,
ou the contrary, that it any spirit, neglectiug the wisdom of
the word os God, obtrude ou us another doctrine, he ought
justly to be suspected of vanity and salsehood. Por, es Satan
transsorms himself into au angelos light, what authority will
the Spirit have with us, unless we can distinguish him by the
most certain criterioul We find him clearly designated, in·
deed, in the word oi the Lord; but these unhappy meu are
fondly beut on delusion, even to their own destruction, seelring
a spirit rather from themselves than sroru him. But they
plead, that it is unworthy of the Spirit of God, to whom all
things ought to be subject, to be made subject to the Scripture;
as though it were ignominious to the Holy Spirit to be every
where equal and uniform, iu all things invariably consistent
with himself. 1f he were to be conformed to the rules os
