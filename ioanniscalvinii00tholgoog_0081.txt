committed to vriting, that it might not be lest rn oblivion, or

Since it is evident, therefore, that God, fereseeing 1110 m·

all those 10 whom he determined to make 1110 instructions

God, it is necessary for us to pursue this right way. We must
corne, 1 say, to the word, which contains a just and lively de·
scription of God as he appears in his works‚ when these works
are estimated, not according to our depraved judgment, bnt by
the rule of eternal truth. 11 we deviate from it, as 1 have just
observed, though we run with the utmost celerity‚ yet, being
ent of the course, we shall never resch the geal. For it must
be concluded‚ that the light of the Divine countenance, which
even the Apostle says‘ ‘no man ean approach unte ’(7 110 like

David, inculcating the necessity 01 1110 removal 01 superstitious
