108 summum or erre ι [aoox 1.

since the Greek word terpora signifies nothing else but to wor-
ship, what they say is equivalent to a confession that they
adore their imeges, but without adoration. Nor can they
justly object, that Iam trying to insnare them with words:
they betray their own ignorauce in their endeavours to raiae a
mist before the eyes of the simple. But, however eloquent
they may be, they will never be able, by their rhetoric, to
prove one and the same thing to be two different things. Let
them point out, l say, a difference in fact, that they may be ac·
eounted different from ancient idolaters. For as an adulterer,
or homicide, will not escape the imputation os guilt, by giving
his crime a new and arbitrary name, so it is absurd that these
persons should be exculpated by the subtle invention of a name,
if they really differ in no respect from those idolaters whom
they themselves are constrained to condemn. But their case
is so far from being different from that of former idolaters, that
the source of all the evil is a preposterous emulation, with
which they have rivalled them by exercising their minds in
contriving, and their hands in forming, visiblc symbols of the
Deity.

Xll. Nevertheless, Ι am not so scrupulous as to think that
no images ought everto be permittcd. But since sculpture and
painting are gists of God, l wish fora pure and legitimate nse
of both3 lest those things, which the Lord hath conferred on
us for his glory and our benefit, be not only corrupted by pre·
posterous abuse, but even perverted to our ruin. We think it
unlawful to make any visible figure as a representation of God,
because he hath himself forbidden it, and it cannot be done
without detracting, in some measure, from his glory. Let it
not be supposed that we are singular in this opinion 3 for that
all sound writers have uniformly reprobated the practice, must
be evident to persons conversant with their works. ll, then, it
be not lawful to make any corporea] representation of God,
much less will it be lawful to worship it for God, or to worship
God in it· We conclude, therefore, that nothing should be
painted and engraved but objects visiblc to our eyes: the Di-
vine Majesty‚ which issar above the reach of human sight,
ought not to be corrupted by unscemly ligures. The subjects
of those arts consist partly of histories and transactions‚ partly
of images and corporeul forms, without reference to any transac-
tions. The former are of some use in information or recollec-
tion; the latter, as far as l see, can furnish nothing but amuse-
ment. And yet it is evident, that almost all the images, which
have hitherto been set up in the churches, have been of this
latter description. Hence it may be seen, that they were placed
there, not with judgment and discrimination, bnt from a foolish

and inconsiderate passion for them. l say nothing here of the
