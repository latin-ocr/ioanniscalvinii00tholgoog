hand, make the ministers of Saum instrumente of the Holy
Spirit. But if they speels their real sentiments, let them
answer me sincerely, what nation or place they consider as the
seat of the Church, from the time when, by a deoree of the
council of Basil, Eugenius was deposed and degmded from the
pontificato, and Amadeus substituted in his ploce. 'I’hey can·
not deny that the council, as far as relatas to external forms,
was a lawful ono, aud summoned not only by one pope, but by
two. There Eugenius was pronounced guilty of schism, re-
bellion, and obstinaoy, together with all the host of oerdinols
aud bishops who had joined him in attempting a dissolution
of the council. Yet afterwards, essisted by the favour of

’ lmowingly and voluntarily ordnined by heretice. Brit if it had
never been ascertained before, that the Church is not confined
to externel pompe, they would themselves afford us abundent
proof of it, who have so long superciliously exhibited them·
selves to the world under the title of the Church, though they
were at the same time the deadly plagues of it. 1 speak not
of their morale, and those tragice] exploits with which all their
lives abeund, since they profess themselves to be Pherisees‚
who are to be heard and not imitated. lrefer to the very doc·
