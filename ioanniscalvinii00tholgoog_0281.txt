'Pherefore the most merciful God, when he determined on our
redemption, became himself our Redeemer in the person of hia
only begotten Son!

llI. Another branch of our reconciliation with God was
this-that man, who had ruined himself by his own disobe-
’ dience, should remedy his condition by obedience, should
satisfy the justice of God, and suffer the punishment of hia
sin. Our Lord then made his appearance as a real man; he
put on the character of Adam, and assumed his name, to act
as his substitute in his obedience to the Father, to lay down
our flesh as the price of satisfaction to the justice of God; aud
to suffer the punishment which we had deserved, in the same
nature in which the offence had been committed. As it would
have been impossible, therefore, for one who was only God to
suffer death, or for one who was a mere man to overcome it,
he associated the human nature with the Divino, that he might
submit the weakness os the former to death, as au atonement
for sins; and that with the power of the latter he might cou-
tend with death, and obtain a victory on our behalf. Those
who despoil Christ, therefore, either of his Divinity or his hu·
manity, either diminish his majesty and glory, or obscure his
goodness. Nor are they, on the other hand, less injurious to
men, whose saith they weaken and subvert; since it carmot
stand any longer than it rests upon this foundation. Moreover,
the Redeemer to be expected was that Son of Abraham and
David, whom God had promised iu the law and the prophets.
Hence the minds of the faithful derive another advantage, be·
cause from the circumstance of his ancestry being traced to
David and to Abraham, they have an additional ussurance that
this is the Christ, who was celebrated iu so many prophecies.
But we should particularly remember‚ what l have just stated -
that our common nature is a pledge of our fellowship with the
Son of God; that, clothed iu our flesh, he vanquished sin and
death, in order that the victory and triumph might be ours;
that tho flesh which he received from us he offered upas a
sacrifice, in order to expiate and obliterate our guilt, and ap-
pease the just wrath of the Father.

IV. 'Phe persons who consider these things, with the dili·

gent attention which they deserve, will easily disregard vague
speculations which attract miuds that are inconstant and fond
of novelty. Such is the notiou, that Christ would have be·
come man, even though the human raca had needed no re-
demption. l grant, indeed, that at the original creation, and in
the state of integrity, he was exalted as head over angela and
man; for which reason Paul calls him “ the first-born of every
