has lost it? 1 certainly do not intend to contradict Salomon,
who asserta that “ God hath made man upright3 but they have
sought out many inventions.'' (s) But man, by his degeneracy,
having shipwreclred both himself and all his excellences,
whatever is attributed to his primitive state, it does not imme·
diately follow that it belongs to his vitiated and degenerated
nature. Therefore 1 reply, not only to them, but also to
Ecclesiasticus himself, whoever he ba: If you design to teach
man to seelr within himself a power to attain salvatiou, your
authority is not so great in our estimation as to obtain even
the smallest degree of credit, in opposition to tha undoubted
word of God. But if you only aim to repress tha malignity of
the ilesh, which vaiuly attempts to vindicate itself by trans·
ferring its crimes to God, and you therefore reply, that man
was originally endued with rectitude, from which it is evident
that he was the cause of his own ruin, 1 readily assent to it;
provided we also agree in this, that through his own guilt he
is now despoiled of those ornaments with which God invested
him at the beginning, and so unite in confessing, that in his
present situation he needs not an advocate, but a physician.

XIX. But there is nothing which our adversaries have more
frequently in their mouths, than the parable of Christ concern-
ing tha traveller, who was left by robbers in the road half

dead. (t) 1 know it is the common opinion of almost all wri-
ters, that the calamity of the human race is represented under
the type of this traveller. Hence they argue, that man is not
so mutilated by the violence of sin and the davil, but that he
still retains some relies of his former excellences, since heis
said to have been left only hals dead; for what becomes of the
remaining portion of life, unless there romain some rectitude
both of reason and will? In tha first place, what could they
say, ifl refused to admit their allegory? For there is uo
doubt but that this interpretation, invented by the fathers, is
foreign to the genuine sense of our Lord's discourse. Allego-
ries ought to ba extended no further than they are supported
by the authority of Scripture3 for they are far from affording
of themselves a sufficient foundation for any doctrines. Nor
is there any want of arguments by which, if l chose, I could
completely confuta this erroneous notion; for the word of God
does not leave man in the possession of a proportion of life,
but teaches, that as far as respects happiness of life, he is
wholly dead. Paul, when speaking of our redernption, says,
not that we were recovered when half dead, but that “even
when we were dead, we were raised up.'’ He calls not on the
half dead, but on those who are io the grave, sleeping the
