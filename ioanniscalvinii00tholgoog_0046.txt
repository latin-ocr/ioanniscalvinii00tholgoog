rather have rejected aud deserted that Gospel which appeared
to be the nursery os. so many disputes, the cause os so many
dmgers, the occasion os so many offences? Bnt in such dis·
ficulties as these, their minda were relieved by this reflection,
that Christ is the “ stone ο1 stumbling and rock of offence,’' (s)
“set sor the sall and rising again ο1 many, and 1ο1 a sign
which shall be spoken against ; '⁵ (g) and armed with this con·
fidenee, they proceeded boldly through all the derigers os
tnmnlts and offences. The same consideration should support
ua, since Paul declares it to be the perpetual characteres the
Gospel, that it is “a savonr of death unto death in them that
perish,’' (t) although it was rather given us to be the “ savour
os life unte lifc,'' and “the power ο1 God to '’ the ‘¹ salvation ”
os the faithful ; (i) which we also should certainly experience
it to be, if we did not corrupt this eminent gift os God by our
ingratitudo, and pervert to our destruction what ought to be a

ο1 the devil, the minister of sin‚” (l) And it is unjust to
charge us with such motivas and designs, of which we have
never given cause sor the least suspicion. ls it probable that
we are meditating the subversion os kingdomsi—we, who
were never heard to utter a sections word, whose lives were
ever known to be peaceahlc and honest while we lived under
your government, and who, even now in our exile, cease not to

pray sor all prosperity to attend yonrsels and your kingdom!
ls it probable that we are secking an unlimited license to com·
mit crimes with impunityi in whose conduct, though many ,
things may be blamed, yet there is nothing worthy of such
severe reproach! Nor have wo, by Divino Gracc, profited so
little in· the Gospel, bnt that our life may be an example to our
detractors of chastity, liberality, mercy, temporanee, patience,
