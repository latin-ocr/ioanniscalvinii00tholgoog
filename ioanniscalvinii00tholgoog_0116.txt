impropriety and indecency conspicuous in most of thern, aad

the wauton licentiousness displayed in them by the painters
and statuaries, at whichI bave before hinted: lonly essert,
that even if they were intrinsically faultless, still they would
be altogether anavailing for the purposes of instruction.

Xlll. But, passing over that difference also, let us consider,
as wc proceed, whether it be expedient to have any images at
all in Christian temples, either descriptiva of historical events,
or representative of human forms. ln the first place, if the
authority of the ancient Church have any influenco with us,
let us remember, that for about five hundred years, while re·
ligion continued in a more prosperans state, and purer doctrine
prevailed, the Christian churches were generally without
images. They were then first introduced, therefore, to orna·
ment the churches, when the purity of the ministry bad begun
to degenerate. Ι will not dispute what was the reason which
influenced the first authors of them; but if you compare one
age with another, you will see that they were much declined
from the integrity of those who had no images Who can
suppose, that those holy fathers would have permitted the
Charch to remain so long destitute of what they judged use·
ful and salutary for iti The fact was, that, instead of omitting
thern through ignoranoe or negligence, they perceived thern
to be of little or no use, but, on the contrary, pregnant with
much danger, and, therefore, intentionally and wisely re·
jected thern. This is asserted in express terme by Augustino ε
“ When they are fixed,'’ says he, “in those places in an hon·
ourable elevation, to attract the attention of those who are

senses, they affect weak minds, so that they appear to thern
to live and breathe,'' tre. (e) And in another place: “For
that representation of members leads, and, as it were, con·
strains, the mind, which animates a body, to suppose that
body to be endued with perception, which it sees to be very
similar to its owu,’' dac. And a little after: “ ldols have more
influence to bow down an unhappy soul, because they have a
mouth, eyes, ears, and feet, than to correct it, because they
neither speak, nar see, nor hear, nor walk.'’ This indeed
appears to be the reason of John's exhortation to “keep our-
selves,” not only from the worship of idols, but “ from idols ’¹
themselves. And we have found it too true, that, through
the horrible frenzy, which, almost to the total destruction of
piety, bath heretofore possessed the world, as soon as images
are set up in churcbes, there is, as it were, a standard of idol·
