wife of your enemy no less than of your friend: when 110 pro·
hibita theft, 110 permits you not to steal from auy one, whether
he be a friend or an enemy. Now, Paul reduces these two pro·
hibitions of theft and adultery to the rule 01 1010, 001 even
10001100 that they are “briefly comprehended in this saying,
namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'' (11) Either,
then, Paul must have been an erroneous expositor of the law,
or it necessarily follows from this, that we are commanded to love,
not only our friends, but also our enemies. These, therefore,
who so licentiously shake off the yoke commento the children

· 01 God, evidently betray themselves to be the sous of Satan. It

isdoubtful whether they have discovered greater stupidity or
impudence in the publication 01 this dogma For all the
fathers decidedly pronounce that these are mere precepta.
That no doubt was entertained on the subject in the time of
Gregory, appears from his positive assertious; for he treats 1110111
as precepts, as though it had never been controverted. And
how foolishly do they argue! They would be a burden, say
they, too grievous 101 Christians; as though truly any thing
could be conceived 111010 difficult, thau to love God with all
our beart, with all our soul, and with all our strength. Com·
pared, with this 1001, every thing must be accounted easy,
whether'it bc to love an enemy, or to banish from the mind
all desire of revenge. To our imbecility, indeed, every thing
is arduons and 1111101111, 0100 the smallest point in 1110 law. lt
is 1110 Lord in whom we find strength: 101 him give what he
commands, aud let him command what 110 pleases. The being
Christiane under the law 01 grace consists not in unbounded
license uncontrolled by any law, but in being ingrasted into
Christ, by whose grace they are delivered from the curse of
the law, and by whose Spirit they have the law inscribed 00
their hearts. This grace Paul has figuratively denominateda
law, in allusion to the law 01 God, to which he was comparing
and contrasting it. Their disputa concerning the word lewis
a dispute about nothing.

LVIII. Of the same nature is what they have called venial
sin—a term which they apply 10 secret impiety, which is 0
1110001101 the first table, and 10 the direct transgression 01 1110
last commandment. For this is their definition, 11101 “it is
evil desire without any deliberate assent, and without any
long continuance in the beart.’' Now, I essert that evil desire

things which the law requires. We are forbidden to have any
strange gods. When the mind, assaulted by mistrust‚ looks
