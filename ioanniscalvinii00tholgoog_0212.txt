Ι)111110 judgment. And the Divine judgment cannot be per·
ceived, without inspiring a dread 01 death. Compelled also by
proofs 01 110 impotence, it camrot avoid falling into an absolute
despair 01 110 own strength. Both these dispositions produce
humility and dejection. The result 01 011 this is, that the man
terrified with thc apprehension 01 01011101 death, which he
sees justly impending over him for his unrighteousness, betakcs
himself entirely 10 the Divina mercy, as to the only port 01
0011011011; and perceiving his inability to 1111111 the commands
01 the law, and feeling nothing but despair in himself, he im·
plores and expects assistance from another quarter.

lv. But not contented with having conciliated a reverence
for his righteousness, the Lord has also subjoined promises and
threatenings, in order that our hearts might imbibe a love 101
him, and at the same time a hatred to iniquity. For since the
eyes 01 0111 11111111 010 100 111111 10 be attracted with the mere
beauty 01 virtue, 0111 most merciful Father has been graciously
pleased to allure usto the love and worship 01 himself by the
sweetness 01 his rewards. He 0111100110οε, therefore, that he has
reserved rewards 101 virtue, and that the person who obeys his
commandments shall not labour in vain. He proclaims, 011 the
contrary, 1101 only that unrighteousness is execrable in his sight,
but also that it shall not escape with impunity; but that hc
will avenge himself 011 011 the despisers of his majesty. And
to urge us by all possible motivas, he promises also the bless-
ings 01 the present life, as well as eternal felicity, to the obedi·
01100 01 those who keep his commandments, the transgressors
01 which he threatens not only with present calamities, but
with the torments 01 01011101 death. For that promise, “ these
if 0111011 110, he shall live in them,'’ (g) and this correspondent
tlrreatening, “the 00111 that sinneth‚ it shall die,'' (Ιι) undoubt-
edly relate to a future and endless 1111111011011111 01 death.
Wherever wc read of the Divine benevolence or wrath, the
former comprehends eternal life, tho latter eternal destruction.
Now, 01 present blessings and curses, the law contains a long
catalogue. The penal sanctions display the consummate purity
01 God, which cannot tolerate iniquity; while the promises
1101 only manifest his perfect love 01 righteousnass, which he
cannot defraud 01 110 reward, but likewise illustrate his won-
derful goodness. For since we, with all that belongs to us,
are indebted to his majesty, whatever he requires 01 us, he
most justly demands as the payment 01 0 debt; but the pay·
nrent 01 0 110111 10 1101 0111111011 10 remuneration. Therefore he
recedes from the strictness 01 his 01011110, when he proposes a
reward 10 0111 obedience, which is not performed spontaneously,
