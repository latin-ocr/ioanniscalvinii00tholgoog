pressiori 01 the will 01 God, were 10011011 and irivolous3 where·
00 God then intended to discover bis fixed aud eternal counsel,
and even something more secret. To the same purpose also
is that assertion 01 Christ, “ My Father worketh hitherto, and
I work.” (0) For, by affirmiug that, from the' beginning 01
the world, he had continually cooperated with the Father, he
makes a more explicit declaration 01 what had been brielly
glanced at by Moses. We conclude, therefore, that God spake
thus at tho creation, that the Word might‘have his part in the
work, aud 00 that operation be common to both. But John
speaks more clearly than all others, when he represents tlte
Word, who from the beginning was God with God, as in
union with the Father, the original cause 01011 things. For
to the Word he both attributes a real and permanent essence,
and assigna some peculiar property3 and plainly ‘shows how
God, by speaking, created the world. Therefore, as all Divine
revelatione are justly entitled 1110 word ⁰s God, so we ought
chiefly to esteem that substantial Word the source 01 011 re·
velatione, who is liable to uo variation, who remains with God
perpetually one and the same, and who is God himself. η

VIII. Here we are interrupted by some clamorous objectors,
who, since they cannot openly rob him 01 his divinity, secretly
steal 110111 111111 his eternity. For they say, that the Word only
began 10 exist, when God opened his sacred mouth 111 the cre-
ation 01 the world. But they are too inconsiderate ln imagin·
ing something new in the substance 01 God. For, as those
names 01 God, which relate to his external works, began to he
ascribed to him aster the existence 01 111009 works, as when he
is called the Creator 01 heaven and earth, so piety neither ac·
knowledges nor admits any name, sigrrisying that God has
found any thing new to huppen to 1111110911. For, could any
thing, srorn any quarter, effect 0 change 111 him, it would contra·
dict the assertion 01 James, that “ every good gift and every per·
fect gift is from above, and cometh down 110111 the Father 01
lights, with whom is no variableness 01 shadow 01 turning.'' (p)
Nothing, then, 10 more intolerable, than to suppose a beginning
01 that Word, which was always God, and afterwards 1110019-
ator 011119 world. But they argue, in their own apprehension
most acutely, 11101 Moses, by representing God as having
then spoken 101 1119 first time, implies also, that there was uo
Word in him beforc; than which nothing is more absurd. For
it is not 10 be concluded, because any thing begins 10 be man·
ifested at a certain time, that it had no prior existence. l form
