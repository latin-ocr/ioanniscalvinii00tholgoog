God in the face of Jesus Christ.” (a) For when he appeared
in this his image, he made himself visible, aa it were, in com·
parison with the obscure and shadowy representation of him
which had been given before. This renders the ingratitudo and
obstinacy of those, who shut their eyes amid this meridiari blaze,
so muchthe morevile and detestable. And therefore Paul
says that Satan, “the god of this world, hath blinded their
minds, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ should
abina unto them.” (y)

lI. Now, I understand the gospel to be a clear manifestation
of the mystery of Christ. I grant indeed, since Paul styles the
gospel tlte doctrine os saith, (z) that whatever promises we
- find in the law conseming the gracious remissiori of sins, by
which God reconciles men to himself, are accounted parts of it.
For he opposes faith to those terrors which torment and ha·

Whence it follows, that taking the word gospel in a large sense,
it comprehende all those testimonies, which God formerly gave
to the fathers, of his mercy and paternal favour, but it is more
eminently applicable to the promulgation of the grace exhibited
in Christ. 'I'his acceptationis not only sanctioned by com·
mon use, but supported by the authority of Christ and the
Apostles. Whence it is properly said of him, that he “ preached
the gospel of the kingdom.” (a) And Mark introduces himself
with this preface: “The beginning of the gospel of Jesus
Christ.” But it is needless to collect more passages to prove a
thing sufficiently known. Christ, then, by his advent, “bath
brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.'’ (b)
By these expressions Paul means, not that the fathers were im·
merged in the shades of death, till the Son of God became in·
cunata, but, claiming for the gospel this honourable preroga·
tive, he teaches that it is a new and unusual kind of legation,
in which God has performed those things that he had promisedy
that the truth of the promises might appear in the person of
his Son. For though the faithful have always experienced the
truth of the assertion of Paul, that “all the promises of God in
him are Yea, and in him Amen,'’ (c) because they have been
scaled in their hearts, yet, since he has completed in his body
all the parts of our salvation, the lively exhibition of those things
has justly obtained new and singular praise. Hence this de·
claration of Christ: “ Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and
the angcls of God ascending and descending upon the Son of
man.'’ (d) For though he seems to allude to the ladder which
