how he performs his operatione within thern. But there are
other testimonias, which go further3 ae those which relate to
the hardoning of Pharaoh: “I will harden his (Pharaoh's)
heart, that he shall not let the people go.’' ζ r) Afterwards the
Lord says, “ Ι have hardened his heart.” (a) Did he harden it
by not mollifying it? That is true; but he did somewhat
more, for he delivered his heart to Satan to be confirmed in
obstinacy3 whence he had before said, “I will harden his
heart.’' The people march out of Egypt3 the inhabitants of
the country meet thamin a hostile manner: by whom were
they excited? Moses expressly declared to the people, that
it was the Lord who had hardened their hearts. (t) The
Psalmist, reciting the same history, sayS, “ He turned their heart
to hate his people.'’ (v) Now, it cannot be said that they fell in
consequence of being deprived of the counsel of God. For
if they are “hardencd ’' and “ turned‚'’ they are positively in-
clined to that point. Resides, whenever it has pleased him
to punish the transgressione of his people, how has he ex·
ecuted his work by means of the reprobate? ln suche manner
that any one may see, that the efficacy os the action proceedcd
from him, and that they were only the ministers of his will.
Wherefcre he threatened sometimes that he would call them
forth by hissing, (w) sometimes that he would use thern as a
natm) to entangle, sometimes as a hammer (y) to strike the
people of lsrael. But he particularly declared himself to be
operativa in thern, when he called Sennacherib an axe,(z)
which was both directed and driven by his hand. Augustino
somewhere makes the following correct distinction: “ that they
sin, proceeds from themselves; that in sinning they perform
this or that particular action, is from the power of God, who
divides the darkness according to his pleasure.”

V. Now that the ministry of Satan is concerned in instiga-
ting the reprobate, whenever the Lord directs them hither or
thither by his providence, may be sufficiently proved even
from one passage. For it is frequently asserted in Samuel that
an evil spirit of the Lord, and an evil spirit from the Lord, either
agitatcd or quitted Saul. (a) To refer this to the Holy Spirit
were impious. An impure spirit, therefore, is called a spirit of
ch, because it acts according to his command and by his power,
being rather an instrument in the performance of the action,
than itself the author of it. We must add, alsa, what is ad·
vanced by Paul, that “God shall send strong delusion, that
they who believed not the truth should believe a lie.'' (b) Yet
