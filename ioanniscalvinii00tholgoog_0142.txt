the same cause.'' But if any persons find greater difficulty in
what we now assert, that there iano consent between God
and man, in cases where man by his righteous influenoe com·
mits unlawful actions, let them remember what is edvanced by
Augustino in another place: “Who cau but tremble at those
judgments, when God does even in the hearts of the wicked
whatsoever he pleases, and yet rendere to them according to
their demerits i '' And certainly it would no more be right to
attribute to God the blame of the perfidy os Judas, because he
decrced the delivery of his Son, and actually delivered him to
death, than to transfer to Judas the praise os redemption.
Theresore the same writer elsewhere informs us, that in this
scrutiny God inquires, not what men could have done, nor
what they have done, bnt what they intended to do, that he
may take coguizance os their design and their will. Let those
to whom there appears any harshuess in this procedure, con-
sider a little how far their obstinacy is tolerable, while they
reject a truth which is attested by plain testimonias of scripture,
because it exceeds their comprehension, and condemn the pub·
lication of those things which God, unless he had known
that the knowledge ol them would be useful, would never have
commanded to be taught by his Prophets and Apostles. For
our wisdom ought to consist in embracing with gentle docility,
and without any exception, all that is delivered in the sacred
Scriptores But those who oppose this doctrine with less
modesty and greater violence, since it is evident that their oppo-
sition is against God, are unworthy os a longer refutation.
