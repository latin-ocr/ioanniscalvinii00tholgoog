only in the human will, from which proceeds the root of evil,
and in which rests the foundation of the kingdom of Satan,
that is, sin. ν

ΙΙ. Very different, in such instances, is the method of the
Divine operation. And that we may heve a clearer view of it,
let us take as an example the calamity which holy Job suffered
from the Chaldeaus. (a) The Chaldeans massacred his shep-
herds, and committed hostile depredatione on his flock. Now,
the wickedness of their procedure is evident3 yet in these
transactione Satan was not unconcerned; for with him the
history states the whole affair to have originated. But Job
himself recognizes in it the work of the Lord, whom he asserts
to have taken from him those things of which he had been
plundered by the Chaldeans. How can we refer the same
action to God, to Satan, and to man, as being each the author
of it, without either excusing Satan by associating him with
God, or making God the author of evil? Very easily, if we
examine, first, the end for which the action was designed, and
secondly, the manner in which it was affected. The desigu
of the Lord is to exercise the patience of his servant by ad·
versity3 Satan endeavours to drive him to despair: the Chalde·
ans, iu defiance of law and justice, desire to enrich themselves
by the property of another. So great a diversity of design
makes a great distinction in the action. There is no less
difference in the manner. The Lord permits his servant to be
afflicted by Satan: the Chaldeans, whom he commissions to
executa his purpose, he permits aud resigns to he impelled by
Satan: Satan, with his envenorned stings, instigates the miuds
of the ChaldeanS, otherwise very depraved, to perpetrate the
crime: they furiously rush into the act of injustice, and over·
whelm themselves iu criminality. Satan therefore is properly
said to work in the reprobate, in whom he exercises his do·
minion; that is, the kingdom of iniquity. God also is said to
work in a way proper to himself, because Satan, being the
instrument of his wrath, turns himself hither and thither at his
appointment and command, to executa his righteous judgments.
Here Ι allude not to the universal influcnce of God, by which
all creaturas are sustained, and from which they derive an
ability to perform whatever they do. lspeak only os that
special influeuce which appears in every particular act. We
see, theu, that the same action is without absurdity ascribed to
God, to Satan, and to man; but the variety iu the end and in
the manner, causes the righteousness of God to shine without
the least blemish, and the iniquity of Satan and of man to
betray itself to its own disgrace.
