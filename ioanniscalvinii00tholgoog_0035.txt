wonders, “should deceive (if possible) the very elect.” (p)
And Paul has told us, that the kingdom ot' Antichrist would
be “with all power, and signs, and lying wonders.” (q) But
these miracles (they say) are wrought, not by idols, or sor·
cerere, or false propheta, but by saints3 as is we were ignorant,
that it isa stratagcm of Satan to “ transsonn ’' himself “into an
angel of light.'’ (r) At the tomb os Jeremiah, (s) who was
buried in Egypt, the Egyptians formerly offered sacrifices and
other divine honours. Was not this abusing God’s holy prophet
to the purposes os idolatryl Yet they supposed this venera-
tion os his sepulchre to be rewarded with a cure for the bite os
serpents. What shall we say, but that it has been, and ever

but their excellenoes they either overlook, or conceal, or eor·
rupt; so that it may be truly said to be their only stndy to
collect dross from the midst of gold. Then they ovorwhelm
us with senseless clamours, as despisers and enomics of the
fathers. But we do not hold them in such contempt, but that,
is it were consistent with my present design, 1 could easily
support by their suffragos most of tho sentiments that we now
maintain. But while we make use of their writings, we always
remember that “all things are ours,'' to serve us, not to have
