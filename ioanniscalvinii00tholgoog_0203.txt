right, or in punishing the despisers of his majesty. In some,
indeed, this state of mind is more evident, iu others more con·
cealed, but itis really the case of all who are yet unregenerate,
that they are induced to attend to the law, not by a voluntary
submission, but with reluctsnce and resistance‚ only by the
violence of sear. But yet this constrained and extorted right·
eousness is necessary to the community, whose public tran·
quillity is provided for by God in this instance, while he pre·
· vents all things being involved in confusion, which would
certainly be the case, if all men were permitted to pursue
their own inclinatione. Moreover, it is useful even to the
children of God, to be exercised by its discipline before their
vocation‚ while they are destitute of the Spirit of sanctification,
and arc absorbed in carnal folly. For when the dread of Di·
vine wengeance restrains them even from external licentious-
ness, although, their minds being not yet subdued, they make
but a slow progress at present, yet they are in some measure
accustomed to bear the yoke of righteousness; so that when
they are called, they may not be entirely unaccustomed to its
discipline, as a thing altogether unknown. To this¹ office of
the law the Apostle appears particularly to have referred, when
ha says, “that the law is not made for a righteons man, but for
the lawless and disobedieut; for the ungodly and for sinners;
for unholy and profane; sor murderers of fathers and murderers
of mothers3 for manslayers, for whoremongers, sor them that “
defile themselves with mankind, for men-stealers, for liam, sor
perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is con·
trary to sound doctrine.” (u) For he herc signifies that it
restrains the violence of the carnal desires, which would other-
wise indulge themselves in the most unbounded licentiousness.

XI. But we may apply to both what he elsewhere asserta,
that to the Jews “ the law was a schoolmaster to bring them to
Christ 3 ” (o) forthere are two kinds os persons who are led to
Christ by its discipline. Some, whom we mentioned in the
first place, from too much confidence either in their own
strength or in their own righteousness, arc unfit to receive the
grace of Christ, till they have first been stripped of every thing.
Ι Tho laW, therefore, reduces thern to humility by a knowledge
of their own misery‚ that thus they may be prepared to pray
for that os which they before supposed themselves not desti·
tute. Others need a bridle to restrain thern, lest they abandon
. themselves to carnal licentiousness, to such a degree as wholly
to depart from all practice of righteousness. For where the
Spirit does not yet reign, there is sometimes such a violent
ebullition of the passions, as to occasion great danger of the soul
that is under their influence being swallowed up in forget·
