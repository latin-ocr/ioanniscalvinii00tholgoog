finally disposing all things according to the dictates of the
highest reason.

IX. We see that there is no need of any long or leborioua
argumentation, to obtain and produce testimonies sor illustra·
ting and asserting the Divina Majesty; since, from the few
which we have selected and cursorily mentioned, it appears
that they are every where so evident and obvious, as easily to
b'e distinguished by the eyes, and pointed out with the fingere.
And here it must again be observed, that we are invited to a
knowledge of God, not such as, content with empty specula·

tion, merely floats in tlre hrain, but such as will be solid aud ’

fruitful, if rightly received and rooted in our hearts. For the
Lord is manifested by his perfectione: perceiviug the influente
and enjoying the bonefits of which, we must necessarily ba
more acutely impressed with such a knowledge, than if we
imagined a Deity of whose influence we had no perception.
Whence we conclude this to be the right way, and the best
methodos secking God, not with presumptuous curiosity to
attemptari examination of his essence, which is rather to be
adored than too curiously investigated3 but to contemplate

him in his works, in which lre approaches and familiarizes, .

and, in some measure, communicatas himself to us. To this
the Apostlc referred, when he said, that he is not to be sought
far off, since, by his attribute of omnipresence, hc dwells in
every one os us. (l) Therefore David, having before confessed
his greatness ineffable, after he descende to the mention os his
works, adds, that he will “ declare this greatness.’' (m) Where-
fore it becomes ns also to apply ortrselves to such an investiga·
tion of God, as may fill our understanding with admiration, ·
and powcrfully interest our feelings. And, as Augustius sorne-
where teaches, being incapable of comprehendirtg him, and
fainting, as it were, nuder his immensity, we must take a view
of his works, that we may be refreshed with his gooduess. (n)

X. Now, such a knowledge ought not only to excite us to
the worship of God, but likewise to awalren and arouse us to
the hope of a future life. For when wc consider, that the
specimens given by the Lord, both of his clemency andos his
severity, are only begun, and not completed, we certainly
should esteem these as preludes to greater things, of which
the manifestation and sullexhibition are deferred to another life.
When we see that pious men are loaded with afflictions hy the
impious, harassed with injuries, oppressed with calumnias, and
vexed with contumelious and opprobrious treatment; that the
wicked, on the contrary, flourish, prosper, obtain ease and
diguity, and all with impunity, — we should immediately con·
