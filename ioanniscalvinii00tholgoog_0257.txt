, fection. And the force of the expression must be carefully
examined3 for he does not, according to the foolish dream of
some sophista, concede the first plaoe to sels-love, and assign
the second to the love of our neighbour; but rather transfers
to others that affection of love which we naturally restrict to
ourselves. Whence the Apostle asserts that “ charity seeketh
not her own.'' (a) Nor is their argument, that every thing
regtdated by any standard is inferior to the standard by which
it is regulated, worthy os the least attention. For God does
not appoint our sels-love as the rule, to which our love to
others should be subordinate 3 but whereas, through our natural
depravity, our love used to terminate in ourselves, he shows
that it ought now to be diffirsed abroad3 that we may be ready
to do any service to our neighbour with as much alacrity,
ardour, and solicitude, as to ourselves.

Lv. Now, since Christ has demonstratod, in the parable of
the Samaritan, that the word “ neighbour ” comprehende every

man, even the greatest stranger, we have no reason to limit the ·

commandment of love to our own relations or friends. Ido
not deny, that the more closely any person is united to us, the
greater claim he has to the assistance of our kind offiees. For
- the condition of humanity requires, that men should perform
more acts of kindness to each other, in proportion to the close·
ness of the bonds by which they are connected, whether of
relationship, or acquaintance, or vicinity ; and this without any
offence to God, by whose providence we are constrained to it.
But I essert, that the whole human race, without any excep-
tion, should be comprehended in the same affection of love,
· and that in this respect there is no difference between the bar·
barian and the Grecian, the worthy and unworthy, the friend
and the soe3 sor they are to be considered in God, and not in
themselves, and whenever we deviate from this view of the
subject, it is no wonder if we sall into many errors. Where-
fore, if we wish to adhere to the true law of love, our eyes
must chiefly be directed, not to man, the prospect of whom
would impress us with hatred more frequently than with love,
batto God, who commanda that our love to him be diffused
among all mankind 3 so that this must always be a fundamental
maxim with us, that whatever be the character of a man, yet
we ought to love him because we love God.

LVI. Wherefore the schoohnen have discovered either their
ignorance or their wickedness in a most pestilent manner,
when, treating of the precepts prohibiting the desire of re-
venge, and enjoining the love of our cnemies, which were an·
ciently delivered to all the Jews, and afterwards equally to all

(a) 1 Cor. xiii. 5.
