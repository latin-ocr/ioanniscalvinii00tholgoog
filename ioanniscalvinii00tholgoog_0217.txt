worshipped. 'rue substance of this precept, then, will be, that
true piety‚ that is, the worship of his mejesty, is pleasing to
God, and that he abominates impiety. Thus in every com·
mandment we should first examine the subjectos it, in the
next place we should inquire the end of it, till we discover
what the Legislator really declares in it to be either pleasing or
displeasing to him. Lastly, we must draw an argument from
this commondment to the opposito of it, in this manner:- lf
this please God, the contrary must displease him; if this dis-
please him, the contrary must please him; if he enjoiu this,
he forbids the eontrary; if he forbid this, he enjoius the
contrary.

IX. What we now rather obscurely hiut at, will be fully
and practically elucidated in our exposition of the command·
ments. Wherefore it is sufficient to have suggested it; only
the last position, which otherwise might uot be understood, or,
if understood, might seem unreasouable, requires to be briefly
established by suitable proof. It needs no proof, that an iu-
junction of any thing good is a prohibition of the opposite
evil 3 for every man will concede it. And common sense will
easily admit, that a prohibition of crimes is a command to
practise the contrary dutics. lt is commonly considered asa
commendation of virtues, when censure is passed on the op·
posite vices. But we require somewhat more thau is corn·
monly intended by those forms of expression. For men
generally understand the virtue which is opposite to any vice
to be an abstinence from that vice; but we affirm that it goes
further, evento the actual performauce of the opposite duty.
Therefore, in this precept, “Thou shaltnot kill,'' the common
sense of mankind will perceive nothing more than that we
ought to abstain from all acts of injury to others, and from all
desire to commit any such acts. 1 maintain that it also irn-
plies, that we should do every thing that we possibly can
towards the preservation of the life of our neighbour. And
uot to speak without reason, l prove it in the following man·
ner: God forbids us to injure the safety of our brother, because
he wishes his life to be dear and precious to us : he therefore
at the same time requires of us all those offices of love which
may contributo to the preservation of it. ΊῚιυε we perceive,
that the end of the precept will always discover to us what·
ever it enjoius or forbids us to do.

X. Many reasons are frequently given, why God has, as it
were, iu incompleta preceptS, rather partially intimated his
will than positively expressed it; but the reason which affords
rue more satisfaction then all others is the following. Because
the flesh always endeavours to extenuate, and by specious pre·
texts to conceal the turpitude of sin, unless it be excecdingly
