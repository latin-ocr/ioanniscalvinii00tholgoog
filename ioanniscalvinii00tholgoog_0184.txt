not sufficient, because they are not equal to so great a work,
Paul has expressed himself with great impropriety. Away, there·
sore, with these sophisms: “ lt is not of him that willeth, nor of
him that runueth 3 ” therefore there is some williug and somerun·
ning. For the meaning of Paul is more simple — lt is neither
our williug nor our running, which procures for usa way of
salvation, but solely the mercy of God. For he expresses here
the same sentiment as he does to Titus, when hc says, “that
the kindness and love of God towards man appeared, not by
works of righteousness which we have done, but according to
his mercy.'’ (o) The very persons, who argue that Paul, in
denying that it isos him that willeth or os him that runneth‚ irn-
plies that tlrereis some williug aud some running, would not
allow me to use the same mode of reasoning, that we have
done some good works, because Paul denies that we have ob·
tained the favour of God by any works which we have done.
But if they perceive a flaw in this argumentation, let them
open their eyes, and they will perceive a similar fallacy in
their own. For the argument on which Angustiae rests the
dispute is unauswerable: “ If it be said, that it is not of him
that willeth, nor of him that runneth, merely because neither
our williug nor our running is sufficient, it may, on the eon·
trary, be retorted, that it is not of the mercy of God, because
that does not act alone.'’ ( p) 'Phelatter position being absurd,
Angustiae justly concludes the meaning of this passage to be,
that there is no good will in man, unless it be prepared by the
Lord; not but that we ought to will and to run, but because
God works in us both the one and the other. With similar
want of jndgment‚ some pervert this declaration of Paul, “We
are labourers together with God3 '' (q) which, without doubt, is
restricted solely to ministers, who are denominated “ workers
with him,'' not that they contributa any thing of themselves,
but because God makes use of their agency, after he has qua·
lified them and furnislred them with the necessary taleuts.
XVllI. They produce a passage from Ecclesiasticus, which
is well known to be a book of doubtful authority. But though
we should not reject it, which, nevertheless, if we chose, we
might justly do, what testimony does it afford in support of
free will? The writer says, that man, as soon as he was
created, was left iu the power of his own will; that precepta
were given to him, which if he kept, he should also be kept
by them; that he had life and death, good and evil, set before
him, arrd that whatever he desired, would be given him. (r)
Let it be granted, that man at his creation was endowed with
a power of choosing life or death. What if we reply, that he
