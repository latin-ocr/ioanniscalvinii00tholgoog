servers of them “perfect as pertaining to the conscience,'’ that
by animal victims itcould neither expiate sius nor procura
true holiness. (q) He concludes, therefore, that it contained “a
shadow of good things to corne, but not the very image of the
things3 '' (r) and that consequently it had no other office, but
to serve as an introduction to “ a better hope,'’ (s) which is ex·
hibited in the gospel. Here we have to inquire in what
respect the Legal covenant is compared with the Evangelical,
the ministry of Christ with the ministry of Moses. For if the
comparison related to the substance of the promises, there
would be a great discordauce between the two testaments3
butas the state of the question leads us to a different point,
we must attend to the scope of the apostle‚ iu order to discover
the truth. Let us, theu, bring forward the covenant, which
God has once made, which is etarual, and never to be abo·
lished. The accomplishment, whence it derives its establish-
ment and ratification, is Christ. While such a confirmation
was waited for, the Lord by Moses prescribed ceremonies to
serve as solemn symbols of the confirmation. It came to be a
subject of coutentiou, whether the ceremonies ordaiued in the
law ought to cease and give place to Christ. Now, though these
ceremonies were only accideuts or concomitante of the covenant,
yet being the instruments of its administration, they bear the
name of the covenaut; as it is common to give to other saera·
ments the names of the things they represent. Inaword, there·
fore, what is here called the Old Testament is a solemn method
of confirming the covenant, consisting of ceremonies and sacri·
fices. Since it contains nothing substantial‚ unless we pro·
ceed further, the apostle contende that it ought to be repealed
and abrogated, iu order to make way for Christ, the Surety aud
Mediator of a better testament‚ (t) by whom eternal sanctifica-
tion has been at once procured for the elect, and those trans·
gressions obliterated, which remaiued under the law. Or,if
you prefer it, take the following statement of it; that the Old
Testament of the Lord was that which was delivered to the
Jews, involved in a shadowy and inefficacious observanoe of
ceremonies, and that it was therefore temporary, because it re·
mainadas it were in suspense, till it was supported by a firm
and substantial confirmation; but that it was made new and
eternal, when it was consecrated and established by the blood
of Christ. Whence Christ calls the cup which he gives to
his disciples in the supper, “the cup of the New Testament in
his blood ; ''(a) to signify that when the testament of God is
scaled with his blood, the truth of it is then accomplished‚ and
thus it is made new and eternal.
