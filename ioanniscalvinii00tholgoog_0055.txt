righteousness, wisdom, and strength, we fondly flatter onr-
selves, and fancy we are little less than demigods. But, if we
once elevate our thoughts tc God, and consider his nature, and
the consummate perfection of his righteonsness, wisdom, and
strength, to which we ought to be conformed, - what before
charmed us in ourselves under the false pretext of righteeus·
ness, will soon be loathed as the greatest iniquity3 what
strangely deceived ns under the title of wisdom, will be de·
spised as extreme folly; and what wore the appearance of
strength, will be proved to be most wretched impotence. So
very remote from the divine purity is what seems in ns the
highest perfectiou.

111. Hence that horror and amaretnent with which the
Scripture always represents the saints to have been impressed
and disturbed, on every discovery of the presence of God. For
when we see those, who before his appearance stood secure and
firm, so astonished and affrighted at the manifestation of his
glory, as to faint and almost expire through fear,-we must
infer that man is never sufficiently affected with a knowledge
of his own meanness, till he has compared himself with the
Divine Majesty. Of this consternation we have frequent ex·
amples in the Judges and Prophets; so that it was a common
expression among the Lord’s people - “ We shall die, because
we have seen God.”(b) Therefore the history cf Job, to
humble meu with a consciousness of their pollution, impotenca,
and folly, derives its prinoipal argument from a description of
the Divine purity, power, and wisdom. And not without rea·
son. For we see how Abraham, the nearer he approached to
behold the glory of the Lerd, the more fully acknowledged
himself to be but “dust and ashes;” (c) aud how Elias (d)
could not bear his approach without covering his face, his ap-
pearance is so formidable. And what can man do, all vile and
corrupt, when fear constrains even the cherubim themselves tc
veil their faces? This is what the prophet lsaiah speaks of-
“the moon shall be confonnded, and the sun ashamed, when
the Lord of hosts shall reign: '’ (e) that is, when he shall make
a fuller and nearer exhibition of his splendour, it shall eclipse
the splendour of the brightest object besides. Bnt, though the
knowledge of God and the knowledge of ourselves bc intimate·
ly connected, the proper order of instruction requires us first to
treat of the former, and then to proceed to the discussion of the
latter.
