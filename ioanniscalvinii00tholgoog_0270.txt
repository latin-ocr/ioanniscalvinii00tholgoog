V. Hence it appears in what sense the apostle said, that the
Jews were conducted to Christ by the tuition of the law, be·
fore he was manifested in the flesh. (ro) He confessas also
that they were children and heirs of God, but such as, on ac·
count of their age, required to be kept under the care of a
tutor. (c) For it was reasonable that before the Suu of Right·
eousness was risen, there should be neither such a full blaze
of revelation, nor such great clcamess of understanding.
'I'herefore the Lord dispensed the light of his word to them
in such a manner, that they had yet only a distant and obscure
prospect of it. Paul describes this slendemess of understand·
ing as a state of childhood, which it was the Lord’s will to
exercise in the elementa of this world and in external obser·
vances, as rules of puerile discipline, till the manifestation of
Christ, by whom the knowledge of the faithful was to grow to
maturity. Christ himself alluded to this distinction, when he
said, “The law and the propheta were until John: since that
time the kingdom of God is preached.” (y) What discoveries
did Moses and the prophete make to their contemporaries?
They afforded thern some toste of that wisdom which was in
after times to be clearly manifestad, and gave them a distant
prospect of its future splendour. But when Christ could be
plainly pointed out, the kingdom of God was revealed. For
in him are discovered “all the treasures of wisdom and know·
ledge,'’ (z) by which we penetrate almost into the furthest re·
cesses of heaven.

Vl. Nor is it any objection to our argument, that scarcely a
person can be found in the Christian Church, who is to be
compared with Abraham in the excellency of his faith3 or
that the prophete were distinguished by such energy of tha
Spirit as, even at this day, is sufficient to illuminate the whole
world. For our present inquiry is, not what grace the Lord
has conferred on a few, but what is the ordinary method
which he has pursued in the instruction of his people; such as
is found even among the prophets themselves, who were endued
with peculiar knowledge above others. For theu preachiug is
obscure, as relating to things very distant, and iscomprehended
in types. Besides, notwithstanding their wonderful eminence
in knowledge, yet because they were under a necessity of sub-
mitting to the same tuition as the rest of the people, they are
considered as sustaining the character of children as well as
othere. Finally, none of thern possessed knowledge so clear
as not to partake more or less of the obscurity of the age.
Whence this observation of Christ: “Many prophets and
kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have
