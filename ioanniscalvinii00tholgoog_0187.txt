usas a Father in Christ. This, indeed, was the genuine order
of nature, that the fabric of the world should be a school in
which we might learn piety, and thence be conducted to eternal
life and perfect felicity. But since the fall, whithersoevar
we turn our eyes, the curse of God meets us ou every side,
which, whilst it scizes innocent creatures and involves them in
our guilt, must necessarily overwhelm our souis with despair.
For though God is pleased still to manifest his paternal kind-
ness to us in various ways, yet we cannot, from a contempla·
tion of the world, conclude that he is our Father, when our
conscience disturbans within, and convinces us that our sius
afford a just reason why God should abandou us, aad no longer
esteem us as his children. We are also chargeable with stu·
pidity and ingratitudo, for our rninds, being blinded, do not
perceive the truth; and all our senses being corrupted, we
wickedly defraud God of his glory. We must therefore sub-
scribe to the declaration of Paul: “ For after that in the visdom
of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God
by the foolishness of preachiug to save them that believe.'' (a)
What he denominatas the wisdom of God, is this magnificent
theatra of heaven and earth, which is replete with innumerabis
miracles, and from the contemplation of which we ought wisely
to acquire the knowledge of God. But because we have made
so little improvement in this way, he recalls us to the faith of
Christ, which is despised by unbelievers on account of its appa·
rent folly. Wherefore‚ though the preachiug of the crassis
not agrecable to human reason, we ought, nevertheless, to ern·
brace it with all humility, if we desire to retum to God our
Creator, from whom wc have been alienatcd, and to have him
reassume the character of our Father. Since the fall of thc
first marr, no knowledge of God, without the Mediator, has
been available to salvation. For Christ speaks not of his own
time only, but comprehends all ages, when he says that “this
is life eternal, to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus
Christ, whom thou hast sent.'’(y) And this aggravares the
stupidity of those who set open the gate of heaven to all un·
believers and profane persons, without the grace of Christ,
whom the Scriptura universally represents as the only door of
entrance into salvation. But if any man would restrict this
declaration of Christ to the period of the first promulgation of
the gospel, we are prepared with a refutation. For it has
been a common opinion, in all ages and nations, that those who
are alienated from God, and prouounced accursed, and children
of wrath, cannot please him without a reconciliation. Here
