ridiculous, that he who beholds the thoughts of the beart, and
principally insists on them, should content himself with forming
only the body to true righteousness. Mental homicide, therefore,
is likewise prohibited, and an internal disposition to preserve
the life of our brother is commanded in this law. The hand,
indeed, accomplishes the homicide, but it is conceived by the
mind under the influence of anger and hatred. Examine
whether you can be angry with your brother, without being
inflamed with a desire of doing him some injury. lf you
cannot be angry with him, then you cannot hate him; for
hatred is nothing more than inveterate anger. However you
may dissemble, and endeavour to extricata yourself by vain
subterfuges, whenever there is either anger or hatred, there is
also a disposition to do injury. If you persist in your evasions,
it is already pronounced by the Holy spirit, that “ Whosoever
hateth his brother is a murderer.'’ (d) lt is declared by the
Lord Christ, “that whosoever is angry with his brother with·
out a cause shall be in danger of the judgment3 and whosoever
shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the coun-
cil 3 but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be iu danger of
hell fire.” (e)

¹ XL. Now, the Scriptura states two reasons on which this
precept is founded; the first, that man is the image of God3
the second, that he is our own flesh. Wherefore, unless we
would violate the image of God, we ought to hold the persoual
safety of our neighbour inviolably sacred3 and unless we would
divest ourselves of humanity, we ought to cherish him as our
own flesh. The motives which are derived from the redemp-
tion and grace of Christ will be treated in another place.
These two characters, which are inseparable from the nature
of man, God requires us to consider as motives to our exertions
for liis security3 so that we may reverence his image impressed
on him, and show an affectionate regard sor our own flesh.
That person, therefore, is not innocent of the crime of murder,
who has merely restrained himself from the effusion of blood.
lf you perpetrate, if you attempt, if you only conceive in your
mind any thing iuimical to the safety of another, you stand
guilty of murder. Unless you also endeavour to defend him to
the utmost of your ability and opportunity, you are guilty of
the same inhumari transgressiones the law. But if so much
concern be discovered for the safety of the body, we may con·
clude, how much care and attention should be devoted to the
safety of the soul, which, in the sight of God, is of infinitely
superior value. ·
