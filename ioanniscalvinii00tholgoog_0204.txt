fulness and contempt of God; which would certainly be the
case, if the Lord did not provide this remedy against it.
Those, therefore, whom 110 has destined 10 the inheritance
of his kingdom, 11 110 do not immediately regenerate them,
he keeps under fear by the works 01 the law till the time
of his visitation; not that chaste and pure fear which ought to
be felt by his children, but a fear which is, nevertheless, useful
10 110111 1110111, according to their capacity, to true piety. 01
this we have so many proofs, that there is no need to adduce
any example. For all who have lived for a considerable time
in ignorance 01 God will consessit to have been their experi-
ence, that they were constrained by the law to a certain kind
01 1001 and reverence 01 God, till, being regenerated by his
spirit, they began to love him 110111 their hearts.

ΧΠ. The third use 01 the law, which is the principal oue,
and which is more nearly connected with the proper end of it,
relates to the faithful, in whose hearts the Spirit 01 God already
lives and reigns. For although the law is inscribed and en·
graven on their hearts by the finger 01 God,—that is, although
they are so excited and animated by the direction 01 the Spirit,
that they desire to obey God, —yet they derive a twosold ad·
vantage frorn the law. For they lind it 011 excellent instrument
to give them, from day to day, a better and 111010 certain under·
standing 01 the Divine will to which they aspire, and 100011-
firm them in the knowledge 01 11. As, though a servant be
already influenced by the strongest desire 01 gaining the appro-
bation 01 his master, yet it is necessary for him carefully to
inquire and observo the orders 01 his master, in order to con·
form to them· Nor let any one 01 110 exempt himself from
this necessity; forno matthas already acquired so much wis·
dom, that he could not by the daily instruction 01 the law
make new advances into a purer knowledge 01 the Divine will.
ln the next place, as we need not only instruction, but also
exhortation, the servant 01 God will 11011νο this further advan-
tage from the law; by frequent meditation on it he will be
excited to obedience, he will be confirmed in it, and restrained
110111 the slippery path of transgression. For in this manner
should the saints stimulate themselves, because, with whatever
alacrity they labour for the righteousness of God according 10
the Spirit, yet they are always burdened with the indolence of
the flesh, which prevents their proceeding with due prompti-
tnde. 'Po this flesh the law serves as a whip, urging it, like a
dull and tardy animal, sorwards to its work; and evento the
spiritual man, who is not yet delivered from the biuden of the
flesh, it will bea perpetual spur, that will not permit him 10
101101. Το this use of the law David referred, when he cele·
brated it in such remarkable encomiums as these: “The law
