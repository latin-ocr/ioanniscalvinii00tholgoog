to Shiloh’‘ (o) Again: “This is a nationthat obeyeth not
the voice of the Lord their God, nor receiveth correction: the
Lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.” (p)
Again: “They obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy ’
law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst
them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come
upon them.'' (q) How, say they, could such reproaches be ap-
plicable to those who might immediately reply, It is true that
we desired prosperity and dreaded adversity; but our not obey-
ing the Lord, or hearkening to his voice, in order to obtain
good and to avoid evil, hasbeen owing to our want of liberty,
and subjection to the dominion of sin, lt isin vain, therefore,
to reproach us with evile, which we had no power to avoid.
In answer to this, leaving the pretext of necessity, which is
but a weak and futile plea,1aslr whether they can exculpate
themselves from all guilt. For is they are convicted of any
fault, the Lord justly reproaches them with their perverseness‚
as the cause of their not having experienced the advantage of
his clemency. Let them answer, then, if they can deny that
their own perverse will was the cause of their obstinacy. lf
they find the source of the evil within themselves, why do
they so earnestly inquire after extraneous causes, that they
may not appear to have been the authors of their own ruin?
But if it be true that sinners are deprived of the favours of God,
and chastised with his punishmentS, for their own sin, aud
only for their own, there is great reason why they should hear
those reproaches from his mouth3 that if they obstinately per·
sist in their crimes they may learn in their calamities rather to
accuse and detest their iniquity, than to charge God with un·
righteous cmelty; that if they have not cast off all docility,
they may become weary of their sins, the demerits os which
they see to he misery and min, and may return into the good
way, acknowledging in a serious confession the very thing for
which the Lord rehukes them. And that those reproofs, which
are quoted from the Prophets, have produced this beneficial
effect on the faithful, is evident from the solemn prayer of
Daniel, given us in his ninth chapter. Of the former use of
them we find an example in the Jews, to whom Jeremiah is
commanded to deelare the cause of their miseries; though
nothing could befall thern, otherwise than the Lord had foretold
“ Thou shalt speak all these words unto theru ; but they will not
heerken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will
not answer thee.’' (r) For what purpose, then, it will be asked,
did they speak to persons that were deas? lt was in order
that, in spite of their disinclination and aversion, they might
