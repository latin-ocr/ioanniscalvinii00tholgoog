111. The fathers are sometimes too scmpulous on this sub-
ject, and afraid of a simple confession of the truth, lest they
should afford an occasion to impiety to speak irreverently and
reproachfully of the works of God Though 1 highly approve
this sobriety, yet 1 think we are in no danger, if we simply
maintain what the Scriptura delivers. Even Angustiae at one
time was not free from this scrupulosity3 as when he says that
hardening and blinding belong not to the operation, but to the
prescience of God. But these subtleties are inconsistent with
numerous expressions of the Scriptura, which evidently import
some intervention of God beyond mere foreltnowledge. And
augustine himself, in his fifth book against Julian, contenda
very largely, that sins proceed not only from the permission or
the prescience, but from the power of God, in order that former
sins may thereby be punished. So also what they advancc
concaming permission is too weak to be supported. God is
very frequently said to blind and harden the reprobate, and to
tum, incline, and influence their hearts, as lhave elsewhere
more sully stated. But it afiords no explicationes the nature
of this influence to resort to prescience or pennission. We
auswer, therefore, that it operatas in two ways For, since,
when his light is removed, nothing remains but darkness and
blindness ς since, when his Spirit is withdrawn, our hearts har·
den into stones3 since, when his direction ceases, they are
warped into obliquity; he is properly said to blind, harden, and
incline those whom he deprives of the power of seeing, obey·
ing, and acting aright. The second way, which is much more
consistent with strict propriety of language, is, when, for the
execution of his judgments‚ he, by means of Satan, the mi·
nister of his wrath, directs their counsels to what he pleases, and
excites their wills and strengthens their efforts. Thus, when
Moses relates that Sihon tho king would not grant a free pes·
sage to the people, because God had “ hardened his spirit, and
made his heart obstinate,” he immediately subjoins the end of
God’s design: “ That he might deliver him into thy hand.” (o)
Since God willed his destruction, the obduration of his heart,
therefore, was the Divina preparation for his ruin.

lV. 'I'he following expressions seem to relate to the former
method: “He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and
taketh away the understanding of the aged. He taketh anray
the heart of the chief people of the earth, and causeth thern to

wander in a wildemess where there is no way.'’ (p) Again ε “0
Lord, why hast thou made usto err from thy ways, and har·
dened our heart from thy fear? '’ (q) For these passages rather
indicate what God makes men by deserting them, than show

(o) Dent ii. 30. (p) Job xii. 20, 2⁴. (q) Isaiah lxiii. 17.
