order that they may repent, but rather to teacb us that all
men are overwhelmed with an inevitable calamity, from which
they can never emerge unless they are extricatad by the mercy
01 God. As this could not bc proved unless it were evinced
by the min and destmction 01 our nature, he has adduced these
testimonies, which demonstrate our nature to be totally ruined.
let this, then, be admitted, that men are euch as they are here
described, not only by corrupt habits, but also by a depravity·
01 nature; for otherwise the reasoning 01 the Apostle could
not be supported, “ that there is no salvation forman but from
the mercy 01 God3 since in himself he isin a mined and
desperate condition.'’ Here lehall not attempt to establish
the application 01 the testimonies, to preclude the appearance
01 their being improperly introduced. lshall treat them just
osis they had been originally uttered by Paul, and not quoted
from the Prophets. He divests man first 01 righteousness, that
is, integrity and purity, and then 01 understanding. Defect
os understanding is proved by apostasy from God, the secking
01 whom is the first step in the path 01 wisdom3 but this loss
must necessarily besall those who have revolted from God.
He adds, that all have gone out 01 the way, and are become
altogether corrupt, that there is not one that does good.
'I'ben he subjoins the flagitious crimes, with which they, who
are once abandoned to iniquity, contaminate all the members
01 their bodies. Lastly, he declares them to be destitute 01
the fear 01 God, the mle by which all our steps ought to be
directed. 11 these are the hereditary characters 01 mankind,
in vain do we seek in our nature for any thing that is good.
1 grant, indeed, that all these crimes are not exhibited in every
individual; yet it cannot be denied that this monster lurlrs in
the hearts 01 all. For as the body, which already contains
within itsels the cause and matter 01 a disease, although it has
yet uo sensation 01 pain, cannot be said to enjoy good health,
neither can the soul be esteemed healthy, while it isfull 01
such moral maledies3 although this similitude will not corre·
spond in every particulam sor in the body, however diseased,
there remains the vigour os life; but the soul, immersed in
thie guls 01 iniquity, is not only the subject 01 vices, but to·
tally destitute os every thing that is good.

ΙΙΙ. Α question, nearly the same as we have already an·
swercd, here presente itsels to us again. For in all ages there
have been some persons, who, from the mere dictates 01 nature,
have devoted their whole lives to the pursuit os virtue. And
though many errors might perhaps be discovered in their con-
duct, yet by their pursuit 01 virtue they afforded a proof, that
there was some degree 01 purity in their nature. The value
attached to virtues 01 such a description before God, we shall
