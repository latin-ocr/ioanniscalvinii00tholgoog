the reprobate, in their defection, acted, as far as respected
’ themselves, in direct opposition to the Divino will; but that
this was not possible with respect to the Divine omnipotence3
because, while they are opposing the will of God, his will is
accomplished concerniug them. Whence he exclaims, “ 'Phe
works of the Lord are great, prepared according to all his deter-
minations ; '' (i) so that, in a wonderful and ineffable manner,
that is not done without his will which yet is contrary to his
will; because it would not be done if he did not permit it;
and this permission is not involuntary, but voluntary; nor
would his goodness permit the perpetration of any evil, unless
his omnipotence were able even from that evil to educe good.''

lV. ln the same manner we answer, or rather annihilate,
another objection — that, if God not only uses the agency of the
impious, but governs their designs and affectione, he is the
author of all crimes 3 and therefore men are undeservedly oon·
demned‚ if they execute what God has decreed, because they
obey his will. For his will is improperly confounded with
his precept, between which innumerable examples evinco the
difference to be very great. For although, when Absalom
defiled the wives of his father, it was the will of God by this
disgrace to punish the adultery of David, (lc) he did not there-
fore command that abandoned son to commit incest, unless
perhaps with respect to David, as he speaks of the reproaches
of Shimei. (1) For when he confesses Shimei’s maledictione
to proceed from the Divine command, he by no means com-
meuds his obedience, as though that impudent and worthless
man were fulfilling a Divine precept3 but acknowledging his
tongue as the scourge of God, he patiently submits to the
chastisement. Let it be remembered, that whilst God by
means of the impious fulfils his secret decrees, they are not
excusable, as though they were obedient to his precepta, which
they wantonly and intentionally violate. The direction of the
perverse actions of men, by the secret providence of God, is
illustriously exemplified in the electiones Jeroboam to tho
regal dignity. (m) The temerity and infatuation of the people
in this proceeding are severely condemned, (n) because they
perverted the order established by God, and perfidiously re·
volted from the family of David3 and yet we know that this
event was agreeable to the Divina will. Whence there isan
appearance of contradiction also in the language of Hosea; for
in one place God complains that the erection of that kingdom
was without his knowledge and against his will; but in an-
other declares that he gave Jeroboam to be a king in his
anger. (o) How can these things be reconciled, that Jeroboam
