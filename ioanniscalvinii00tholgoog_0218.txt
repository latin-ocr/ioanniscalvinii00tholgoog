palpable, be has proposed, by way of example, in every kind 01
transgression, that which is most atrocioris and detestable, and
the mention 01 which inspires us with horror, iu order that our
minds might be impressed with the greater detestation 01
every sin. This often deceives us in forming an opinion 01
vices; if they be private, we extenuate them. The Lord
destroys these subterfuges, when he accustoms us to refer the
whole multitude 01 vices to these general heads, which best
represent the abominable nature 01 every speeies of transgres-
sions. For example, anger and hatred are not supposed to be
such execrable crimes when they are mentioued under their
own proper appellations3 but when they are forbidden to us
under the name of murder, we have a elearer perception how
abominable they are in the view of God, by whose word they
are classed under-such a flagitious and horrible species 01
crimes; and being influenccd by his judgment, we accustom
ourselves more seriously to consider the atrociousuess 01 those
offences which wa previously accounted trivial.

XI. ln the third place, let it be considered, what is intended
by the division 01 1110 Divine law into two tables; the frequent
and solemn mention 01 which 011 wisc meu will judge 001 10
be without some particular desigu. And we have a reason 01
hand, which removes all ambiguity on this subject. For God
has divided his law into two parts, which comprise the per·
fection of rigbteousness, so that he has assigned the first part
to the duties of religion, which peculiarly belongs to the wor-
ship of his majesty, and the second to those duties of charity,
which respect 1000. The first foundation 01 rigbteousness is
certainly the worship 01 God; and if thisbe destroyed, all the
other branches of rigbteousness, like the parts of a disjointed
and falling edifice, are torn asunder and scattered. For what
kind 01 rigbteousness will you pretend to, because you refrain
from harassing men by acts 01 111011 and rapine, if 01 1110 same
time you atrociously and sacrilegiously defraud the majesty of
God 01 1110 glory which is due to bimi-because you do not
pollute your body with fornication, if you blasphemously pro·
fane the sacred name of Godi-because you murder noman,
if you strive 10 destroy and extinguish all memory 01 God? 11
is in vain, therefore, to boast 01 rigbteousness without religion 3
as well might the trunk of a body be exhibited as 0 beautiful
object, aster the head has been cut off. Nor is religion only
. the head of rigbteousness, but the very soul of it, constituting
011 its life and vigour ; for without the fear of God, men pre-
serve 00 equity and love among themselves. We therefore call
the worship of God the principle and foundation of rigbteous-
ness, because, if that be wanting, whatever equity, continence,

and temperance intpp may practise among themselves, it is all
voa. 1.
