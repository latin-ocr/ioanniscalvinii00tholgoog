ll. David’s assertion, that “the fool hath said in his heart,
ll'here is no God‚’' (l) is primarily, as we shall soon see in an·
other place, to be restricted to those who extinguish the light
of nature, aud wilfully stupefy themselves. For we see many,
become hardened by bold and habitual transgressions, striving
to banish all remembrauce of God, which the instinctos nature
is still suggesting to their minds. To render their madness
more detestable, he introduces them as expressly denyiug the
existence of God, not that they deprive him of his being, but
because they rob him of his justice and providence, shutting
him up as an idlcr in heaven. Now, as nothing would be more
inconsistent with Deity, than to abendon the government of
the world, leave it to fortune, and connive at the crimes of
men, that they might wauton with impunity, -whoever ex-
tinguishes all fear of the heavenly judgment‚ and indulges
himself in security‚ denies that there is any God. After the
impious have wilfully shut their own eyes, it is the righteous
vengeance of God upon them, to darken their understandings,
so that, seeing, they may not pereeive. (m) David is the best
interpreter of his own meaning, iu another place, where he
says, “ 'l'he wiched have no fear of God before their eyes; ’³ (rt)
and again, that they encourage themselves in their iniquities
with tha flattering persuasion that God doth not see them. (o)
Though they are constrained to acknowledge the existence of
God, yet they rob him of his glory‚ by detracting from his
power. For as God, according to the testimony of Paul,
“cannot deny himself,'’ (p) because he perpetually remains
like himself, - those who feign him to be a vain arrd lifeless
image, are truly said to deuy God. It must also be remarked,
that, though they strive against their own natural understand·
ing, and desire not ouly to banish him thence, but even to an·
nihilate him in heaven, their insensibility can never prevail,
so as to prevent God from sometimes recalling them to his
tribuual. But as no dread restrains them from violent opposi-
tion to the divine will, it is evident, as long as they are carried
away with such a blind impetuosity, that they are govemed
by a brutish forgetfulness of God.

111. Thus is overthrown the vain excuse plsaded by many
for their superstition 3 for they satisfy themselves with any at·
tentiou to religion, however pmposterous, not considering that
the Divino Will is the perpetual rule to which true religion
ought to be conformed 3 that God ever continues lilre himself ;
that he is no spectre or phantasm, to be metamorphosed according
to the fancy of every individual. It is easy to see how super·
stition mocks God with hypocritical services, while it attempta
