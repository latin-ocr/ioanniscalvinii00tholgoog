the grace of nod left us the condition of mutability. In which
it is surprising that such great men were so inconsistent with
themselves For how did it not occur tc Chrysostom, that it
is the election of God, which makes this difference between
meni We are not afraid to allow, what Paul very strenuously
asserta, that all, without exception, are depraved and addicted
to wiclredness ; but with him we add, that the mercy of God
does not permit all to remain in depravity. Therefore, since
we all naturally labour under the sarno discase, they alone re·
cover to whom the Lord has been pleased to apply his healing
hand. 'Phe rest, whom he passes by in righteons judgment‚
putrefy in their corruption till they arc entirely consumed.
And it is from the same cause, that some persovere to the end,
and others decline and fall irr the midst of their course. For
perseverance itself also isa gift of God, which he bestows not
on all men promiscuously, but imperts to whom he pleases. If
we inquire the cause of the difference‚ why some persevero
with constancy, and others fail through instability, no other
can be found, bnt that God sustains the former by his power,
that they perish not, and does not communicate the same
strength to the latter, that they may be examples of inconstancy.

lv. They urge further, that exhortations are given in vain,
that the use of admonitions is superfluous, and that reproofs
are ridiculous, if it be not in the power of the sinner to obey.
When similar objections were formerly made to Augustine, he
was obliged to write his treatiso On Correction arrd Gracc ,· in
which, though he copiously refutes them, he calls his adversa-
ries to this conclusion: “ Ο man, in the commandment loarn what
is your duty: in correction learn, that through your own fault
you have it not: in prayer learn whence you may receive what
you wish to enjoy.” There is nearly the same argument in the
treatise On the Spirit and Lettcr, in which he maintains that
God does not regulate the precepts of his law by the ability of
men, bnt when he has commanded what is right, freely gives
to his elect ability to perform it. This is not a subject that
requires a prolix discussion. First, we are not alone in this
· cause, but have the support of Christ and all the Apostles. Let
our opponente consider how they can obtain the superiority in
a contest with such antagonists. Does Christ, who declares
that without him we can do nothing, (o) on that account the
less reprehend and punish those who without him do what is
evil? Does he therefore relax in his exhortations to every marr
to practise good worlrs? How severely does Paul censure the
Corinthians for their neglect of charity ! (p) Yet he earnestly
prays that charity may be given thern by the Lord. ln bis
