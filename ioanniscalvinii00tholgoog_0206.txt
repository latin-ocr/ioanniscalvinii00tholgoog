to which it exhorta us, it shows us a goal, to aim at which,
during the whole of our liveS, would be equally conducive to
our interest and consistent with our duty; in which attempt it
is happy for us if we fail not. For the whole of this life is a
course, which when we have completed, the Lord will grant
us to reach that goal, towards which at so great a distance our
efforts are now vigorously directed.

XIV. Now, because the law, in regard to the faithful, has the
force of an exhortation‚ not to bind their consciences with a
curse, but by its frequent admonitions to arouse their indolence,
aad reprove their imperfectiori, —many persons, when they de·
sign to express this liberation from its curse, say that the law
(1 still speak of thc moral law) is abrogated to the faithful;
not that it no longer enjoins upon them that which is right,
but only that it ceases to be to them what it was before, no
longer terrifying and confounding their consciences, condemn·
ing and destroying them. And such an abrogation of the law
is clearly taught by Paul. It appears also to have been
preached by our Lord, since he would not have refuted the
opinion concerning his abolishing the law, unless it had pre·
vailed among the Jews. Now, as this opinion could not pre·
vail without any pretext, it is probable that it proceeded from
a false interpretation of his doctrine ς in the same manner as
almost all errors have usually taken some colour from the truth.
But lest we ourselves fall into the same error, let us accurately
distinguish what is abrogated ia the law, and what still remains
in force. When the Lord declares that he came “not to destroy
the law, but to fulfil it,’' and that “till heaven and earth shall
pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wisc pass from the law,
till all be fnlfilled,'’(t) he sufficiently proves that his advent
would detract nothing from the observance of the law. And ’
with sufficient reason, since the express end os his advent was
to heal the transgressione of it. The doctrine of the law re·
mains, therefore, through Christ, inviolable; which by tuition,
admonition, reproof, and correction, forms and preparas us for
every good work.

XV. The assertions of Paul respecting the abrogation of the
law evidently relate, not to the instruction itself, but to the power
of binding the conscience. For the law not only teaches, but
authoritatively requires, obedience to its commands. lf this
obedience be not yielded, and even if there be any partial defr-
cierrcy os duty, it hurls the thunderbolt of its curse. For this
reason the Apostle says, that “as many as are of the works of the
law are under the curse3 for it is written, Cursed is every one
that continueth not in all things.'’ (a) Now, he affirms those to
be “ of the works of the laW,” who place not their righteousness
