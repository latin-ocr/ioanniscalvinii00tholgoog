of all was their interpretation of this paseaget “Aa we have
heard, so have we seen ; ” that therefore God is known, not
only by the hearing of his word, but by the contemplation of
images. ¹Similar is the subtlety 01 Bishop Theodora: “God
is glorious in his saints.” And in another place it is said, “In
the saints that are in the earth:’' therefore this ought to be
referred to images. But their impertinencies and absurdities
are so disgusting, that lam quite ashamed to repeat them.

XV. When they disputa concerning adoration, they bring
forward Jacob’s worshipping of Pharaoh, and os the staff of
Joseph, and of the inscription erected by himself 3 although,
in this last instance, they not only corrupt the sense of the
Scripture, but allege what is nowhere to be found. These
passages also, “ Worship his footstool ; '' “ Worship in his holy
hill 3 '² and, “All the rich of the people shall supplicate thy
face3 ” they consider as apposite and conclusive proofs. lf
any one wished to represent the advocates for images in a
ridiculous point 01 view, could he possibly ascribe to them
greater and grosser instances of folly? But, that uo doubt
of this might remain, Theodosius, bishop of Mira, defends the
propriety of worshipping images from the dreams 01 his arch·
daneon, as seriously as if he had an immediate revelation from
heaven. Now, let the advocates of images go and urge upon
us the decree of that Council; as though those venerable fa·
thers hed not entirely destroyed all their credit by such puerile
treatment of the sacred Scripturas, or such impious and ehame-
ful mutilationes them.

XVl. Icome now to those prodigies of impiety, which it is
wonderful that they ever ventured to broach3 and more won-
derful still, that they have not been opposed with universal
detestation. It is right to exposa this flagitious madness, that
the worship of images may at least be deprived of the pretence
01 antiquity, which the papists falsely urge ln its favour.
Theodosius, bishop 01 Amorum, denounees an anathema
against all who arc averse to the worship 01 images. Another
imputes all the calamities of Greece and the East to the crime
01 not having worshipped them. What punishments, then,
did the Prophcts, Apostles, and Martyrs deserve‚ in whose
time images were unknown? They add further, 11 the image
‘of the emperor be met by processione with persumee and in·
oense, much more is this honour due to the irnages of the saints.
Constantius, bishop 01 constance, in Cyprus, professes his rev·
erence for images, and avows that he will pay them the same
worship and honour as is due to the Trinity, the source of all
life; and whoever refuses to do the sama, he anathematizes
and dismisses with the Manichees and Marcionites. And,
lest you should suppose this to be the private opinion of en
