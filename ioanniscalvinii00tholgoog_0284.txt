Paul not only tells us the end of his mission, but ascending to
the sublime mystery of predestination, very properly repressas
all the licentiorrsness and prurienee of the human mind, by de-
claring, that “the Father hath chosen us in Christ before tha
foundation of the world, and predestinated us to the adoption
of children according to the good pleasure of his will, and
made us accepted in his beloved Son, in whom wa have re-
demption through his blood.’' (b) Here the fall of Adam is
certainly not presupposed, as of anterior date; but we have a
discovery of what was decreed by God before all ages, when
he determined to remedy the misery of mankind. lf any ad·
versmy object again, that this design of God depended on the
fullos man, which he foresaw, it is abundantly sufficient for me,
that every man is proceeding with impious presumption to ima-
gine to himself a new Christ, whoever he be that pcrrnits him·
sels to inquire, or wishes to know, concaming Christ, any more
than God has predestinated in his secret decree. And justly
does Paul, after having been thus treating of the peculiar office
of Christ, implore, on behalf of the Ephesians, the spirit of
understanding, “ that they may be able to comprehend what is
the breadth, aud length, and depth, and height; andro know
the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge ; '’ (c) as though
he would labour to surround our minds with barriers, that
wherever mention is made of Christ, they may not decline in
the smallest degree from the grace of reconciliation. Where-
fore, since “this is '³ testified by Paul to be “ a faithful saying,
that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinuers,’' (d) l
gladly acquiesce in it. And since the same apostle in another
place informs us, that “ the grace, which is now made manifest
by the gospel, was given us in Christ Jesus before the world
began,'’ (e) I conclude that 1 ought to persevera in the same
doctrine with constancy to the end. This modesty is unrea·
sonably censured by Osiander, who in the present age has un·
happily agitated this question, which a few persons had slightly

touched before. He alleges a charge of presumption against .

those who deny that the Son of God would have appeared in
the flesh, if Adam had never fallen, because this tenet is con·
tradicted by uo testimony of Scripture; as if Paul laid no
restraint on such perverse curiosity, when, after having spoken
of the accomplishment of our redemption by Christ, he imme·
diately adds this injunctiou: “ Avoid foolish questions.’' (s )
'Phe frenzy of some, that have been desirous of appearing pro·
digiously acute, has proceeded to such a length as to question
whether the Son of God could assume the nature of an ass.
