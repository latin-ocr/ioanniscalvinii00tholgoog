he says, “My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God 01
lsrael ; ” (o) implying in this that the Lord is grievously dis·
honoured, if perjury be committed in his name. Nor is this
strange; for in such a case we do all that is in our power to
brand his sacred name with a falsehood. And that this form of
expression was customary among the Jews, whanever any man
was called to take an oath, appears from a similar adjuration
used by the Pharisees in the Gospel of John. (p) To this
cautiori we are accustomed by the forms os oaths which are
used in the Scripturas: “ The Lord liveth ; '' (q) “ God do so
and more also to me;’' (r) “leall God forarecord upon my
soul ;'’ (s) which imply‚ that we cannot invoke God to be a
witness to our declarations, without imprecating his vengeance
upon us 11 we be guilty of perjury.

XXV. The name of God is rendered vile and contemptible,
when 11 13 used in unnecessarily swearing evento what is true ;
for in this instance also 11 13 taken in vain. Wherefore 11 will
not be sufficient to abstain from perjury3 unless we also re·
member, that swearing is permitted and appointed, not for the
sake 01 our pleasure or caprice, but from necessity; and that
the lawfnl use of it, therefore, is transgressed by those who
apply it to cases where it is not necessary. Now, no other ne·
cessity can be pretended, but when we want to serve either
religion or charity. This crime, in the present day, is carried
to a very great extent; and it is so much the more intolerable,
since by its frequency it has ceased to be considered as a
crime, though before the Divine tribunal itis deemcd no trivial
offence. For the name of God is universally profaned without
concern in trifling conversations; and it is not considered as
sinful, because this presumptuous wickedness has been 30 long
practised with impunity. But thc Divine command remains
valid3 the sanction remains firm; and a future day will wit·
nass the completion of that part 01 11 which denounces a
particular punishment against those who take his name in vain.
This precept is violated also in another way. lf in our oaths
we substitute the servants of God in the place of God himself,
we are guilty of manifest impiety; because we thereby
transfer to them the glory due to the Deity. Nor is it without
reason, that God, by a special command, enjoins us to swcar by
his name, (t) and by a special prohibition interdicts us srorn
swearing by any strange gods (v) And the Apostle evidently
attests the same, when he sayS, that ‘⁴ men swear by the greater,

lbut thlast (god), because he could swear by no greater, sware by
rmse .'’ w
