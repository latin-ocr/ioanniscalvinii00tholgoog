XLVI. We shall rightly obey this commandment therefore,
if, contented with our own lot, we seelr no gain but in au
honest and lawsul way3 is we neither desire to enrich our·
salves by injustice, nor attempt to ruin the fortune of our neigh-
bour, in order to increase our own; if we do not labour to accu-

receive them as the messengers and apostles os God, render to
them that honour to which the supreme Master has exalted
them, and sumish them with the necessarias os lise. Let
