arising from aknowledge of his benefits. For, till men are
sensible that they owe every thing to God, that they are sup·
ported by his paternal care, that he is the Author of all the
blessings they enjoy‚ and that nothing should be sought inde·
pendently of him, they will never voluntarily submit to his
authority3 they will never trnly and cordially devote them·
selvas to his service, unless they rely upon him alone for true
felicity.

11. Gold and frivolons, then, are the speculatione of those
who employ themselves in disquisitione on the essence of God,
when it would be more interesting to ns to become acquainted
with his character, and to know what is agreeable to his na·
ture. For what end is answered by professing, with Epicu·
rus, that there isa God, who, discarding all concern about the
world, indulges himself in perpetual inactivityl What benefit
arises frorn the knowledge of a God with whom we have no
concern? Our knowledge of God should rather tend, first, to
teach us fear and reverence; and, secondly, to instruct ns to
implore all good at his hand, and to render him the praise of
all that we receive. For how can yon entertain a thought of
God without immediately reflecting, that, being a creature of
bis formation, you must, by right of creatien, be subject to his

were not seduced by its own depravity from the right path of
investigation. For, even at the first, the piens mind dreams
not of any imaginary deity, bot contemplates only the one true
God; and, concerning bim, indulges not the fictions of fancy,
but, content with believing him to be such ns he reveals him·
sels, uses the most diligent and unremitting cantion, lest it
should fall into error by a rash and presumptuous transgression
of his will. He who thus knows him, serrsible that all things
are subject to his control, confides in him as his Guardiao and
Protector, and unreservedly commite himself to his care. As·
sured that he is the author of all blessings, in distress or want
he immediately flies to his protection, and expects his aid.
Persuadcd of his goodness and mercy, he relies on him with
unlimited confidence, nor doubts of finding in his clemencya
remedy provided sor all his evils. Knowing lrirn to be his
Lord and Father‚ he concludes that he ought to mark bis gov-
