fluous mass of vain things. But to leave the consideration of
words, it has been generally admitted, in all ages, that religion
is corrupted and perverted by errore and falsehoods; whence
we infer, that when we allow ourselves any thing from incon·
siderate zeal, the pretext alleged by the superstitious is alto·
gether frivoloua Although this confession is in the mouths
of all, they betray, at the same time, a shameful ignoranee,
neither adhering to the one true God, nor observing any dis· ,
crimination in his worship, as we have before shown. But
God, to essert his own right, proelaims that he is “joeleus”
and will be a severe avenger, if men eonfound him with any
fictitious deity; and then, to retain mankind in obedisses, he
defines his legitimate worship. He comprises both in his law,
where he first binds the faithful to himself, as their sole legis·
lator3 and theu prescribes a rule for the right worship os him
according to his will. Now, of the law, since the uses and
ends of it are various, 1 shall treat in its proper place: at
present, Ι only remark, that it sets up a barrier to prevent men
turning aside to eorrupt modes of worship. Let us remember‚
what Ι have already stated, that, unless every thing belonging
to Divinity remain in God alone, he is spoiled of his honour,
and his worship is violated. And herc it is necessary to ani·
madvert more particularly on the subtle fallacias of supersti-
tion. For it revolts not to strange gods, in sueh a manner as
tc appear to desert the supreme God, or to degrada him to a
level with others; but, allowing him the highest place, it sur·
rounds him witha multitude of inferior deities, among whom
it distributas his honours; and thus, in a cunning and hypocrit-
ieal manner, the glory of Divinity is divided among many, in·
stead os remaining wholly iu one. 'l'hus the ancient idolaters,
Jews as wellas Gentiles, imagined one God, the Father and
Governor of all, and subordinate to him a vast multitude of
other deities; to whom, in common with the supreme God,
they attributed the government of heaven and earth. Thus
the saints, who departed out of this life some ages ago, are
exalted to the society of God, to be worshipped, and invoked,
and celebrated like him. We suppose, indeed, the glory of
God not to be sullied with this abomination; whereas it is, in
agreat measure, suppressed and extinguished, except that we
retain some faint notion of his supreme power; but, at the
same time, deceived with such impostures, we are sedueed to
the worship of various deities.

11. On this account was invented the distinction of latria .
and dulia, as they express themselves, by which they con·
eeived they might safely ascribe divine honours to angele and
deceased men. For it is evident, that the worship which pa·
pista pay to tlte saints differs not in reality from the worship
