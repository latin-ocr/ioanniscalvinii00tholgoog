was demolished, which had so long confined the Divina mercy
within the limits of the Jewish church, and peace was au·
ncunced 1ο thern who were at 0 distance, and 10 thern who
were near, that being both reconciled 10 God, they might

nor JeW, circumcision nor uncircumcision, but Christ is all and

illustraticn 01 1110 superior excellence of the New Testameut
above 1110 Old. lt had, indeed, before been most explicitly au·
nounced in numerous predictions 01 1110 prophets3 but 00 as
that the completion 01 11 was deferred 101110 kingdom of the
Messiab. And even Christ himself mede no advances towards
11011110 first commencement of his preaching, but deferred it
till he should have completed all the parts 01 001 redemption,

Father “a name which is above every name, before which
every knee shall bow.‘' (1) Wherefore, when 11110 000000 was
not yet arrived, he said 10 0 Ganaanitish woman, “I am not
0001 but unto the lost sheep of the house of 101001 : ’‘ (0) nor
did he permit the apostles, 101110 first 1010010001 them, to ex·
ceed these limits. “Go not,” says he, “into the way 01 the
Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritana enter ye not;
but go ratberto the lost sheep of the house 01 101001.” (ro)
And though this calling 01 1110 Gentiles was announced by 00
many testimonias, yet when the apostles were about 10 enter
upon it, it appeared tc them 00 00101 and strange, that they
dreaded it, as if it had been 0 prodigy: indeed it was with
trepidation and reluctance that they at length engaged in it.
Nor is this surprising; 101 11 seemed not 01 all reasonable, that
the Lord, who 10100 many ages had separated 1110 israelites
from the rest of the natione, should, 00 11 were, suddenly change
his design, and annihilato this distinction. lt had indeed baeu
predicted in the prophecies, but they could not pay such great
attention 10 1110 prophecies, 00 10 be wholly unmoved with the
novelty of the circumstance, which forced itsclf on their obser·

given, 01 1110 future ’10001100 01 1110 Gentiles, sufficient 10 iu-
