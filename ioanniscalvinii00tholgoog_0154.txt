reject, being an insinuation that God only waits for ns with
his hand extended, if we choose to accept his assistance. We
grant that such was the primitive condition of man during his
state of integrity, that he could incline to the one side or the
other; but since Adam has taught us by his own example how
miserable free will is, unless God give us both will and power,
what will become 01 usis 116 impart his grace to us in that
small proportioni Nay, we obscure and diminish his grace
by our ingratitude. For the Apostle does 001 160011 that the
grace of a good will is offered to us for our acceptance, but
that he “ worketh in us to will ; ’³ which is equivalent to saying,
that the Lord‚ by his spirit, directs, inclines, and governs our
heart, and reigns in it as in his own possession. Nor does he
promise by Ezekiel that he will give to the elect a new spirit,
only that they may be able to walk, but that they may actually

“ Every man that hath heard of the Father cometh unto me,'' (b)
be understood in any 011161 sense than as a proof of the positive
efficacy of Divine grace ; as Augustine also contende. This grace
the Lord deigns not to give 10 any person promiscuously‚ accord·
ing to the observation commonly attributed, if I mistake 001,
10 000010, that it is denied to 00 man who does what he 000.

011 who seek it, without any exception3 but since none begin to
0661111, bnt those who have been inspired by heavenly grace,
001 even this diminutive portion ought to be taken from his
praise. This is the privilege 01 the elect, that, being regenerated
by 1116 spirit of God, they are led and governcd by his direction.
ererefore Augustino as justly ridicules those who arrogata to
themselves any part 01 6 good volition, as he reprehende others,
who suppose that to be given promiscuously to all, which is
1116 special evidence 01 gratuitous 61601100. “Νο11116,” says
he, “is common 10011 1060, but 1101 31006.” Η6 calls it “a
transparent subtlety, which shines merely with vanity, when
that is extended generally to all, which God confers on whom he
chooses.'' But elsewhere, “ How have you come? by believing.
