XXVIII. The end of this precept is, that, being dead to our
own affections and works, we should meditate on the kingdom
of God, and be exercised in that meditation iu the observancc
of his institutions. But, as it has an aspect peculiar and dis-
tinct from the otherS, it requires a little different kind of expo·
sition. 'Phe fathers frequently call it a sbudoroy commcnd-
ment, because it contains the external observancc of the day,
which was abolished with the rest oi the ligures at the advent
of Christ. And there is much truth in their observati0n; but
it reaches only half of the subject. Whereforc it is necessary
to seek further for an exposition, and to consider three causes,
on which I think 1 have observed this commandmeut to rest.
For it was the design of the heavenly Lawgiver, under the
reatos the seventh day, to give the people os lsrael a figure of
the spiritual rest, by which the faithful ought to refrain from
their own works‚ in order to leave God to work within them.
His design was, secondly, that there should be a stated day, 011
which they might assemble together to hear the law and per·
form the ceremonias, or at least which they might especially
devote to meditations on his works; that by this recollection
they might be led to the exercises of picty. Thirdly‚ he
thought it right that servants, and persons livIng under the ju·
risdiction of others, should be indulged with a day of rest, that
they might enjoy some remissiori from their labour.

XXIX. Yet we are taught iu many places that this adum·
bration of the spiritual rest was the principul design of the
sabbath. For the Lord is hardly so strict in his requisitions of
obedience to any other precept. (s) When he means to inti·

glected‚ there rdmairred no other way iu which he could be
honoured. On the other hand, he notices the observancc of it
with singular errcorniums. Whereforc also, among the other

Divina communicamus, the faithful used very highly to esteem
the revelation of the sabbath. For this is the langrragc of the
Levites ln a solemn assembly, recorded by Nehemiah: “ Thou
