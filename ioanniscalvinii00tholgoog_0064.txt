Holy Spirit. But that being a false and vain shadow of re·
ligion, and scarcely worthy even to be called itsshadow, -it is
easy to infer the wide differente between such a confused
hodon of God, and the piety which is instilled only into the
minda of the faithful, and is the source of religion. Yet
hypocritas, who are dying from God, resort to the artifices of
superstition, for the sake of appearing devoted to him. For
whereas the whole tenor of their life ought to be a perpetual
course of obedience to him, they make no semple of rebelling
against him in almost all their actions, only endeavouriug to
appense him with a few paltry sacrifices. Whereas he ought
to be served with sanctity of life arrd iutegrity of heart, they
invent frivolons trilies and worthless observances‚ to con·
ciliate his favour. They abendon themselves to their im·
purities with tha greater licentiousness, because they confide
in being able to discharge all their duty to him by ridiculous
expiatione. ln a word, whereas their confidence ought to ba
placed on him, they neglect him, and depend upon themselves
or on other creatures. At length they involve themselves in
such a vast accumulatiou of errors, that those sparks which
enable them to discover the glory of God are smothered, and
at last extinguished by the criminal darkness of iniquity.
That seed, which it is impossible to eradicate, a sense of the
existence of a Deity, yet remains; but so corrupted as to pro·
duce only the worst of fruits. Yet this is a further proof of
what I now conteud for, that an idea of Gadis naturally en·
graved on the hearts of mausiaco necessity extorts a confes·
sion of it, even from reprobatas themselves. ln the moment
of tranquillity, they facetionsly mock the Divine Being, and
with loquacious impertineuce derogata from his power. But if
any despair oppress them, it stimulates them to seek him, aud
dictatas concise prayers, which prove that they are not alto·
gether ignorant of God, but that what ought to have appeared
before had been suppressed by obstinacy.
