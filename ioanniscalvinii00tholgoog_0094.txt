that the authority of the prophets has been confirmed by such
pronis, or that what they themselves essert, in order to vin·
dicate the credit due to their declaratione, has been actually
fulfilled! “ Behold, the former things are corne to pass, and
new things do l declara: before they spring forth,l tell you
of them.'' (i) l shall not spealr of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, who,
living in distant countries, but prophesying ,at the same time,

- so exactly accord in their declaratione, as though they had

mutually dictated the words to each other. What shall we ·
say of Daniel? Has not he prophesied of the events of nearly
six hundred years in such a connected series, as if he were
composing a history of transactione already past and universally
known? If pious men properly consider these things, they
will be sufficiently prepared to curb the petulance of the
wicked; for the demonstration is too clear to be liable to any
cavils.

lX. 1 know what is objected by some clamorous men, who
would ostentatiously display the force of their understanding in
opposing divine truth For they inquire, Who has assured us
that Moses and the propheta actually wrote those books which .
bear their names? They even dare to question whether such a
man as Moses ever existed But if any man should call in
question the existence of Plato, or Aristotle, or Cicero, who
would deny that such madness ought to receive corporal pun·
ishment? The law oi Moses has been wonderfully preserved,
rather by the providence of heaven than by the endeavours of
men. And though, through the negligence of the priests, it lay
ior a short tirne concealed, since it was found by the pious king
Josiah, it has continued in the hands of men through every
succeeding age. (lc) Nor, indeed, did Josiah produce it asa
thing unknown or new, but as what had always been public,
and the memory of which was then famous. The protograph
had been appointed to be kept in the temple, and a transcript of
it to be deposited in the royal eschines, ( l) only the priests had
discontinued their ancient custom of publishing the law, and
the people themselves had neglected their wonted reading of it:
yct there scarcely passed an age in which its sanction was not
confirmed and renewed. Were they, who had the writings of
David, ignorant of Mosesi But, to speak of all at once, itis
certain, that their writings descended to posterity only from
hand to hand, (so to speak,) through a long series os years trans·
mitted from the fathers, who partly had heard them speak, and
partly learned from others who heard them, while it was fresh
in their memory, that they had thus spoken.
