in his own conception very shrewdly, said, that whatever we
see, and whatever we do not see, is God. But he imagined
that the Deity was diffused through every part os the world.
But, although God, to keep us within the bounde os sobriety,
speaks but rarely of his essence, yet, by those two attributes,
which I have mentioned, he supersedes all gross imaginatione,
aud repressas the presumption of the humen mind. For, sure·
ly, his immensity ought to inspire us with awe, that we may not
attempt to measure him with our senses; and the spirituality
of his nature prohibite us from entertaining any earthly or car-
nal speculatione conceming him. For the same reason, he re·
presente his residence to be “ in heaven ; ’² for though, as he is
incomprehensible, he fille the earth aleo; yet, seeing that our
minda, from their dulnese, are continually dwelling on the earth,
in order to shake off our sloth and inactivity, he properly raises
us above the world. And here is demoliehed the error of the
Manicheee, who, by maintaining the existence os two original
principles, made the devil, as it were, equal to God. Thie cer·
tainly was both dividing the unity os God, and limiting his im·
mensity. For their daring to abuse certain testimonies os
Scriptura betrayed a shameful ignorance; as the error itsels
evidenced an execrable madneee. The Anthropomorphites also,
who imagined God to be corporeal, because the Scriptura sre-
quently ascribes to him a mouth, ears, eyes, hands, and feet, are
easily resuted. For who, even os the meanest capacity, under·
stands not, that God lieps, as it were, with us, just as nurses
are accustomed to speak to infante? Wheresore, such forms of
expression do not clearly explain the nature os God, but ac·
commodate the knowledge os him to our narrow capacity3 to
accomplish which, the Scriptura must necessarily descend sar
below the height os his majesty.

ll. But he aleo designates himself by another peculiar charac-
ter, by which he may be yet more clearly distinguished; sor,
while he declares himself to be but One, he proposes himself to
be distinctly considered in Three Persons, without apprehending
which, we have only a bare and empty name of God floating in
our braine, without any idea os the true God. Now, that uo
one may vainly dream of three gods, or suppose that the simple
essence of God is divided among the three Persons, we must
seek sor a short arrd easy definition, which will preserve us
from all error. But since some violeutly object to the word
Person, as os human invention, we must first examine the rea-
sonableness ol this objection. When the Apostle denominatos
the Son the express image of the hypostasis of the Father, he
undoubtedly ascribes to the Father some subsistence, in which
he differe from the Son. Porto understand thie word as sy-
nonymous with Essence, (as some interpretare have done, as
