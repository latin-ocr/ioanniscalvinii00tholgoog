longa delay. By the word law, 1 intend, not only the de·
calogue, which prescribes the rule of a pious and righteous life,

but the form of religion delivered from God by the hands of

Moses. For Moses was not maden legislator to abolish the
blessing promised to the seed os Abraham3 on the contrary,

we see him on every occasion reminding the Jews os that
gracious covenant made with their fathers, to which they
were heirs3 as though the object of his mission had been to
renew it. It was very clearly manifested in the ceremonias.

For what could be more vain or frivolous than for men to offer
the fetid stench arisiug from the fat os cattle, in order to
reconcile themselves to God? or to resort to any aspersion os

water or of blood, to cleansc themselves from pollutioni In
short, the whole legal worship, isit be considered in itself, and
contain no shadows and figures os correspondent truths, will
appear perfeetly ridiculous. Wherefore it is not without
reason, that both in the speech of Stephon and in the Epistle
to the Hebrews, that passage is so caresully stated, in which
God commauds Moses to make all things pertainiug to the
tabernaclo “according to the pattern shewed to him in the
mount.” (m) For unless there had been some spiritual design,

to which they were directed, the Jews would have laboured to
no purpose in these observances, as the Gentiles did in their
mummeries. Profane men, who have never seriously devoted,
themselves to the pursuit oi piety, have not patience to hear of

such various ritas: they not only wonder why God should
weary his ancient people with such a mass oi ceremonias, but ,
they even despise and deride them as puerile and ludicrous.
This arises from inattention to the end of the legal figures,
from which if those figures be separated, they must be con·
demned as vain and useless. But tha “pattem,” which is
mentioned, shows that God commanded the sacrifices, not
with a design to occupy his worshippers in terrestrial exercises,
but rather that he might elevate their minds to sublimer ob·
jects. This may be likewise evinced by his nature 3 foras he
is a Spirit, he is pleased with none but spiritual worship.
Testimonies os this truth may be found in the numerous
passages of the Prophets, in which they reprove the stupidity
oi the Jews for supposing that sacrifices possess any real valua
in the sight of God. Do they mean to derogata from the law?
Not at all; but being true interpreters os it, they designed by
this method to direct the eyes of the people to that point from
which the multitude were wandering. Now, from the grace
offered to the Jews, it is inserted as acertain truth, that the
law was not irrespective os Christ; sor Moses mentioned to
