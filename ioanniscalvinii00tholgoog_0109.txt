make no sculpture os Deity‚ while in pictures they indulge
greater liberty than any other natione. But the Lord prohibita
every representation of him, whether made by the statuary, or
by any other artificer, because all similitudes are criminal and
insulting to the Divina Mayesty.

V. l know that it ise very common observation‚ that images
are the books os the illiterate. Gregory said so; but very dis·
ferent is the decisiones the Spirit of God, in whose school
had Gregory been taught, he would never have made such an
assertion. For, since Jeremiah pronounces that “the stoclr is
a doctrine of vanities,'' (t) since Habakkuk represents “a mol·
ten image '’ as “a teacher of lies‚'’ (v)-certainly the general
doctrine to be gathered from these passages is, that whatever
men leam respecting God srom images is equally frivolous aud
salse. Isany one object, that the Prophets only reprehended
those who abuse images to the impious purposes of super·
stition, -that indeed I grant; but affirm also, what is evident
to every one, that they utterly condemn what is assumed by
the papists as an indubitable axiom, that imeges are substitutas
sor books. For they contrast imeges with the true God, as
contraries, which can never agree. This comparison, l say, is
laid down in those passages which 1 have just cited3 that, since
there is only one true God, whom the Jews worshipped, there
can be no visible figures made, to serve as representations os
the Divina Being, without falsehood and criminality; and all
who seek the knowledge os God from such figures are under a
miserable delusion. Were it not true, that all knowledge os
God, sought from images, is corrupt and fallacions, it would not
be so uniformly condemned by the Prophets. This at least
must be granted to us, that, when we maintain the vanity and
fallaciousness of the attempts os men to make visible represen-
tatione οῖ God, we do no other than reeite the express declara·
tions of the Pr0phets.

Vl. Read likewise what hasbeen written on this subject
by lactantius and Eusebius, who hesitate not to assume as a
certainty, that all those whose images are to be seen, were
mortal men. Augustino also conlidently asserts the unlawful·
nass, not only os worshipping images‚ but even of erecting
any with reference to God. Nor does he advance any thing
different from what had, many years before, been decreed by
the Elibertine cou'ncil‚ the thirty-sixth chapter of which is as
follows: “lt hath been decreed, that no picturas be had in
the churches, and that what is worshipped or adored benet
painted on the walls.'’ But most remarkable is what Augus·
tine elsewhere cites from Varro, and to the truth os which he
