GENERAL SYLLABUS.

Tm: design of the Author in these Christian Institutas is
twosold, relating, First, to the knowledge of God, as the way
to attain ablessed immortality; and, in connection with and
subservience to this, Secondly, to the knowledge of ourselves.

ln the prosecution of this design, he strictly follows the
methodos the Apostles’ Oreed, as being most familiar to all
Christiana Foras the Creed consists of four parts, the first
relating to God the Father, the second to the Son, the third
to the Holy Spirit, the fourth to the Church3 so the Author
distributas the whole of this work into Four Books, correspond-

appear from the following detail: —

1. The first article of the Creed relates to God the Father,
and to the creation, conservation, and govemment of all things,
which are included in his omnipotence.

So the first book ison the knowledge of God, considered
as the Creator, Preserver, and Govemor of the universe at
large, and of every thing contained in it. It shows both tha
nature and tendency of the true knowledge of the Creator-
that this is not learned in the schools, but that every man from
his birth is sels-taught it—Yet that the depravity os men is
so great as to corrupt and extinguish this knowledge, partly
by ignorance‚ partly by wickedness; so that it neither lcads
him to glorify God as he ought, nor conducts him to the at·
tainment of happiness—And though this intemal knowledge
isassisted by all the creaturas around, which serve as a minor
to display the Divine perfectioris, yet that man does not profit
by it- Theret‘ore, that to those, whom it is God's will to bring
to an intimate and saving knowledge os himself, he gives his
mitten word; which introduces observations on the sacred
Scriptura-That he has therein revealed himself ; that not

the Father only, but the Father‚ Son, and Holy Spirit, uni-
