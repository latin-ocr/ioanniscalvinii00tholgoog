Jerome, 1 regard u0t; let us inquire what is truth. lshall not
here enter into along discussion 01 the various species of pos·
sibility3 10011 that impossible which has never happened yet,
and which is prevented by the ordination and decree 01 God
110111 ever happcning 111 future. 11 we inquire 110111 the remo·
test period 01 antiquity, 1 assert that there never has existed a
saint, who, surrounded with a body os death, could attain to
such 0 degree 01 love, as to love God with all his heart, with
all his soul, and with all his mind; and, moreover, that there
never has been one, who was not the subject 01 some inordi-
nate desire. Who can deny this? lknow, indeed, what sort
01 saints the folly 01 superstition imagines to itsels, such as
almost excel even the angela 01 heaven in purity; but such an
imagination is repugnant both to Scriptura and to the dictatas
01 experiente. I assert also that no man, who shall exist in
future, will reach the standard 01 11110 perfectiori, unless re·
leased 110111 the burden of the body. This is established by
clear testimonies 01 Scripture: Solomon says, “There is 1101
0 just man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not.'’ (y)
David3 “In thy sight shall no man living be 1001111011.”(ῑ)
Job in many passages affirms the same thing3 (a) but Pa

most plainly 01 011, that “the flesh lusteth against the Spirit,
and the Spirit against the flesh.” (b) Nor does he prove, that
“as many as are 01 the works 01 the law are under the curse‚”
by any other reason but because “it is written, Oursed is every
0110 that continueth not in all things which are written in the
book 01 the law to do them ; '¹ (c) evidently suggesting, and
even taking it sor granted, that no one can continue in them.
Now, whatever is predicted in the Scriptures, must be consi-
dered as perpetual, and even as necessary. With-a similar fal-
lacy Augustine used to be teased by the Pelagians, who main·
taiued that it is an injury to God, to say that he commanda
111010 111011 the faithful through his grace are able to perform.
To avoid their cavil, 110 admitted that the Lord might, if 110
chose, exalta mortal man to the purity 01 angels; but that he
neither had ever done it, nor would ever do it, because 110 had
declared otherwise in the Scripturas. (d) This 1 do not deny3
but I add that it is absurd to dispute concerning the power 01
God, in opposition to his veracity; and that, therefore, it 01-
fords no room 101 cavilling, when any one maintains that to

be impossible, which the Scriptores declare will never happen.
But if the disputa be about the term, the Lord, in reply to 011
inquiry 01 his disciples, “ Who, then, can be saved? ’' says,
“With men this is impossible3 but with God all things are
