ιο him by the authority of man? Every man will rather
abida by his own judgment, than be subject to the will of
another. Since, then, the following of the custom of a city,
or the consent of antiquity, in divine worship, is too weak and
frail a bond of piety, it remeius for God himself ιο give a rev·
elation concerning himself from heaven.

XIV. Vain, therefore, is the light ufforded us in the for·
marion of the world to illustrate the glory of its Author3
which, though its rays be diffused all around us, is insufficient
to conduct us into the right way. Some sparks, indeed, are
kindled, but smothered before they have emitted any great
degree of light. Wherefore the Apostle, in the place before
cited, says, “By faith we understand that the worlds were

- framed by the word of God;” (d) thus intimating, that the
' invisible Deity was represented by such visibie objects, yet

that we have no eyes to discern him, unless they be illuminated
through faith by an internal revelation of God. Nor does
Paul, where he observes, that “that which may be known of
God is manifest'’ (e) in the creation of the world, design such
amanifestation as burnan sagacity may comprehend; but
rather shows, that its utmost extent is to'render men inexcusa-
ble. The same writer also, though in one place (s ) he denies
that God is to be traced far off, seeing he dwells within
us, yet teoches, in another place, (g) the consequences of such
aproximity. God, says he, ‘⁴ in times past suffered all nations
to walk in their own ways. Nevertheless he left not himself
without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from
heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food arrd
gladness.'’ (h) Though the Lord, then, is not destitute of a
testimony eoncenring himself, while with various and most
abundant benignity he sweetly allures mankind to a knowledge
of him, yet they persist in following their own ways, their
pernicious and fatal errors. .

XV. But whatever deficiency os natural ahility preventa us
from attaining the pure and clear knowledge of God, yet, since
that deficiency arises from our own fault, we are left without
any excuse. Nor indeed can we set up any pretence of ig·
norance, that will prevent our own consciences from perpetually
accusing us of indolence and ingratitudo. Truly it would be a
defence worthy to be admitted, if a man should plcad that he
wanted ears to hear the truth, for the publication of which
even the mute creaturas are supplied with most melodicus
voices, if he should allege that his eyes are not capable of ἵ
oeeing what is demonstrated by the creaturas without the help
