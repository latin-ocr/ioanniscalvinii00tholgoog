what properly belongs to God is, by concession, transferred to
us, is plain t'rom the words os John: “He that is'begotten ol'
God, keepeth himsels.” (c) The preachers of froewill lay
hold of this expression, as though we were saved partly by the
Divine power, partly by our own, as though we did not re-
ceive from heaven this very preservation which the Apostle
mentions. Wheret'ore also Christ prays that his Father would
“keep ” us “from evil ; ” (d) and we know that the pious, in
their warfare against Satan, obtain the victory by no other
arms than those which are furnished by God. Theresore Pe·
ter, having enjoined us to “ purify ” our “ souls, in obeying the
truth,” immediately adds, as a correction, “through the Spi-
rit.” (e) Finally, the impotence of all human strength in the
spiritual conflictis briefly demonstrated by John when he says, ·
“ Whosoever is born ot' God cannot sin; for his seed remaineth
in him:’' (s) and in another place he adds the reason, that
“this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our
faith·’' (el

XII. There is also a testimony cited from the law os Moses,
which appears directly repugnant to our solution, For, after
having published the law, he makes the following solemn de·
claration to the people: “This commandment, which Ι com-
mand thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far
off : it is not in heaven: but the word is very nigh unto thee,
in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.'’ (h)
If these expressions be understood merely os the precepta, 1
grant that they have much weight in the present argument.
For although we might easily elude their force, by saying that
they treat ol the facility and promptitude, not ot' observance,
but of knowledge, yet still perhaps they might leave some
doubt. Bnt the Apostle, in whose expositions there is no am·
biguity, removes all our doubts, by affirming that Moses here
spake os the doctrine of the gospel. (i) But is any one should
obstinately contend, that Paul has violently perverted the pas·
sage from its genuine meaning, by applying it to the gospel,
although his presumption could not be acquitted of impiety,
yet there is enough to resuta him, independently os the autho·
rity of the Apostle. For, is Moses spoke only os the precepts,
he was deceiving the people with the vainest confidence. For
would they not have precipitated themselves into ruin, if they
had attempted the observance of the law in their own strength,
as a thing of no difficulty? What, then, becomes of the very
obvious facility with which the law may be observed, when
there appears no access to lt but over a fatal precipicel Where-
