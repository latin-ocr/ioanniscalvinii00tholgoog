former times. Elias was asked whether it was not he “that
troubled lsrael.'' (a) Christ was represented bytho Jews as
guilty of sedition. (y) The apostles were aocused cf stirring
up popular commotione. (z) Wherein does this differ from

the conduct of those who, at the present day, impute to us all
the disturbantes, tumults, and sententious, that break cut
against us? But the proper answer to such accusatione has
been taught us by Elias, that the dissemination of errore and
the raising of tumults is not chargeable on us, but on those
who are resisting the power of God. But as this one reply
is sufficient to repress their temerity, so, on the otherhend, we
must meet the weakness of some persons, who are frequently
disturbed with such offences, and become unsettled and waver-
ing in their minds. NoW, that they may not stumble and fall
amidst this agitatior and perplexity, let them know thartha
apostles in their day experienced the same things that now be-

when they heard that “where sin abounded grace did much
more abound,” immediately concluded, Let us “continue in
sin, that grace may abound.'’ When they heard that the
faithful were “not under the law‚” they immediately croaked,
“We will sin, because we are not under thelaW‚b11t11nder

churches he had raised. “Some preached” the gospel “of
envy and sulse, not in sincerity,'' maliciously “supposing to
add afflietion to his bonds.”(c) In some places the Gospel
was attended with little benefit. “All were secking their
own, not the things of Jesus Christ.'’ (d) Others returned
“like dogs to their vomit, and like swine to their wallowing
in the mire.’' (e) Many perverted the liberty of the spirit into
the licentiousness of the flesh. Many irrsinuated themselves
as brethren, who afterwards brought the pious into dangers.
Various contentions were excited among the brethren them·
