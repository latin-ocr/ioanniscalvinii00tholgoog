ΤΗΣ savum COMMANDMENT.

Thou skalt not manmit adultw.

XLI. The end of this precept is, that because God loves
chastity and purity, we ought to depart from all uneleanness
'Phe sum of it therefore is, that we ought not to be pollutedby
any carnal impurity, or libidinous intemperance. To this pro·
hibition corresponds the affirmative injunction, that every part
of our lives ought to be regulated by chastity and continence.
But he expressly forbids adultcry, to which all incontinence
tends; in order that by the turpitude os that which is very
gross and palpable, being an infamous pollution of the body,
he may lead usto abominata every unlawful passion. Since
man was created in such astate as not to live a solitary life,
but to be united to a help-meet; and moreover since the curse
of sin has increased this necessity, -the Lord has afforded us
ample assistance in this case by the institution of marriage -a
connection which he has not only originated by his authority,
but also sanetified by his blessing. Whence it appears, that
every other union, but that os marriage, is cursed in his sight ;
and that the conjugal union itsell is appointed as a remedy lor
our necessity, that we may not break out into unrestrained
licentiousness. Let us not fiatter ourselves, therefore, since
we hear that there can be no cohabitation of mule and female,
except in marriage, without the curse os God.

and the violence os the passions consequent upon the fall, have
rendered a union of the sexes doubly necessary, except to those
whom God has exempted srom that necessity by peculiar
grace, let every one caresully examine what is given to him.
Virginity, lacknowledge, is a virtue not to be despised. But
as this is denied to some, and to others is granted only lor a sea-
son, let those who are troubled with incontinenoe, and carmot
succeed in resisting it, avail themselves os the help of marriage,
that they may preserve their chastity according to the degree
os their calling. For persons who “cannot receive this say-
ing,'’ (f) il they do not assist their lrailty by the remedy os-

sered and granted to thern, oppose God and resist his ordinance.
Here let no one object, as many do in the present day, that
with the helpes God he can do all things. For the assistance
ol God is granted only to them who wallr in his ways, that is,
in their calling; which is deserted by all those who neglect
the means which God has ufforded them, and strive to over-
