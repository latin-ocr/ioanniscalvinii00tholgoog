of God, for they adore God and them promiscuonsly3 bnt
when they are accused of it, they evade the charge with this
subterfuge, that they preserve inviolate ιο God what belongs
to him, because they leave him Meyer. But since the ques·
tion relates to a thing, not toaword, who can bear their care·
less trifling on the most important of all subjecta? But, to pass
this msc, they will gain nothing at last by their distinction,
but that they render worship ιο God alone, and service to the
saints. For sarpere, in Greek, signifies the same aa crrltus in
Latin, [and worship iu English ς] but ὁοολεια properly signifies
servitus, [antaee ,·] aud yet, in the scriptume, this distinctionis
sometimes disregarded. But, suppose it to be a constant dia·
tinction, it remeius to be inquired, what is tha meaning ot'
each term. Λατροα is worship; δουλοα is service. Now, no
oue doubts, that ιο serve is mora than to worship or honour.
For it would be irksome ιο serve many persons, whom you
would not refuse to honour. So unjnst is the distribution, ιο
essign the greater to the saints, and leave to God that which is
less. But many of the ancients, it is urged, have used this
distinction. What is that ιο the purpose, if every one per·
ceives it to be not only improper, but altogether frivolous?
111. Leaving these subtleties, let us consider the subject
itself. Paul, when he reminds the Galatians what they had
been before they were illuminated in the knowledge of God,
says, that they “did service ιο them which by nature were no
gods.”(s) 'I'hough he mentions not λασροα, (worship) is
their idolatry therefore excusable? He certainly condemns that
perverse superstition, which he denominatos δουλοα, (service,)
equally as much as if he had used the word λατροα, (worship.)
And when Christ repels the assault of Satan with this ahield,
“lt is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God‚'’ (g)
the word sarpeia carne not into the question ; for Satan required
nothing but sperauisse, (prostration, or adcretion.) So, when
John is reprehended by an angel, for having fallen on his
knees before him, (t) we must not understand that John was
so stupid as to intend ιο transfer to an angel the honour due ex·
clusively tc God. But since all worship, that is connected
with religion, cannot but savour of Divino, he could not
(speravero) prostrate himself before the angel, without de·
tracting from the glory of God. We read, indeed, frequently,
of men having been worshipped3 but that was civil honour,
so to speak3 religion has a different design; and no sooner is
religion connected with worship, or homage, thenit produces
aprofanation os the Divina honour. We may see the sarne
in Cornelius, who had not rnade such asinali progress in
piety, aa not to ascribe supreme worship to God alone. When
