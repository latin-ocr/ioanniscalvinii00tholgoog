which arises from malicc, and a violent propensity to detraction.
This commandment also extends sosares to forbid us to effect
a pleasantry tinctured with scurrilous and bitter sarcasms, se·
verely lashing the saults of others under the appearance os sport3
which is the practice os some who aim at the praise os raillery,
to the prejudice of the modesty and seelings os others3 for
such wantonness sometimes fixes a lasting stigma on the cha·
racters oi our brethren. Now, it we turn our eyes to the Le-
gislator whose proper right it is to rule our ears and our minda,
as much as our tongues, it will certainly appear that an avidity
os hearing detraction, and an unrcasonable propensity to unfa-
vourablc opinions respecting others, are equally prohibited.
For it would be ridiculous sor any one to suppose that God
hares slander in the tongue, and does not reprobate malice in
the heart. Wheresore, is we possess the truc sear and love of
God, let us make it our study‚ that as iar as is practicable and
expedient, and consistent with charity, we devote neither our
tongues nor our ears to opprobrious and malicious raillery, nor
inadvertently attend to uniavourable suspicions ; but that, put-
ting fair constructions on every man’s words and actious, we
regulate our hearts‚ our ears, and our tongues, with a view to
preserve the reputation of all around us.

XLIX. 'ic end oi this precept is, that, since it is the will
of God that our. whole soul should bc under the influence os,
love, every desire inconsistent with charity ought to be ex·
pelled from our minds. 'Phe sum, then, will be, that no thought
should obtrude itsels upon us, which would excite in our
minds any desire that is noxious, and tends to the detriment
os another. To which corresponds the affirmative precept,
that all onr conceptions, deliberations, resolutions, and underta-
kings, ought to be consistent with the benefit and advantage os
our neighbours. But here wc meet with what appears to be
a great and perplexing difficulty. Foris our previous assertions
be true, that the terms adultery and theft comprehend the licen·

tious desire, and the injurious and criminal intention, this may
be thought to have superseded the necessity os a separate com·
mand being afterwards introduced, forbidding us to covet the
possessions oi others. But we shall easily solve this difficulty
by a distinction between intention and concupiscence. For an
