justly refer those oaths which we find used by Paul in as·
sertion of the dignity of the gospel; because the Apostles, in
the exercise of their fonctions, were not private persons, but
public ministers of God. And indeed Ι will not deny that

these are the safest oaths; because they are sanctioned by the
strongest testimonies of Scriptura. A magistrate is directed, in
a dubious case, to put a witness to his cath, and the witness, on
the other hand, is required to answer on his oath; and the
Apostle says, that human controversies are adjusted by this ex·
pedient. (b) ln this precept both parties are furnished witha
complete justification of their conduct. Moreover we may
obscrve, that among the ancient heathen a public and solemn
cath was held in great reverence3 bnt that common ones,
which they used in their ordinary intercourse, were not es-
teemed of any, or of much importance, because they imagined
that these were not regarded by the Divina majesty. But it
wonld be too dangerous to condemn private oaths, which are
taken, in cases of necessity, with sobriety, integrity, and reve·
rence, since they are supported both by reason and by scriptura!
examples. For if it be lawful for private persons in an im·
portant and serious affair to appeal to God as a judge between
them, nruch more must it be allowable to invoke him asa
witness. Your brother will accuse you of perfidy; you endea-
vour to exculpate yoursels; he will not permit himself by any
means to be satisfied. lf your reputation be endangered by his
obstinate malignity, you may, without any offence, appeal to
the judgrnent of God, that in his own time he will manifest
your innocence. If the words be strictly examined, it is a less
thing to appeal to hinr as a witness than as a judgc. Ι see not,
therefore, why we should essert such au appeal to him to be
unlawful. There are not wanting numerous examples of ir.
lf the oath of Abraham and lsaac with Abimelech be alleged
to have been taken in' a public capacity, certainly Jacob
and Laban were private personS, and yet they confirmed the
covcnant between thern by a mutual oath. (c) Boaz was a
private person, who confirmed in the sarne manner his promise
of marriage to Ruth. (d) Obadiah was a private person, a
righteous man, and one that feared the Lord, who declared
with an oath the fact of which he wished to convince Elijah. (e)
lcan find, therefore, no better rule, than that we regulare our
oaths in such a manner, that they be not rash or inconsiderate,
wanton or frivolous, but used in cases of real necessity, assor
vindicating the glory of the Lord, or promoting the edification
of our brother, which is the end ¹of this commandment of
the law.
