promises of this kind, to which a condition is annexed, we
shall speak in another place, and evince that there is no absur-
dity in the impossibility of their conrpletion. With respect to
the present question, 1 deny that God is cruel or insincere tous,
when he invites us to merit his favours, though he knows us to
be altogether incapable of doing this. For as the promises are
offered equally to the faithful and to the impious, they have
their use with them both. As by the precepta God disturbs
the consciences of the impious, that they may not enjoy too
much pleasure in sin without any recollection of his judgments,
ao in the promises he calls theru to attest how unworthy they
are of his kindness. For who can deny that it is most equita·
ble and proper for the Lord to bless those who worship him,
and severely to punish the despisers of his majesty? God acts,
therefore, in a right and orderly marmer, when, addressing the
impious, who are bound with the fetters os sin, he adds to the
promises this condition, that when they shall have departed
from their wickedness, they shall then, and not till then, enjoy
his favours; even for this sole reason, that they may know that
they are deservedly excluded from those benefits which belong
to the worshippers of the true God. On the other hand, since
he designa by all means to stimulate the faithful to implore his
grace, it will not be at all strange, if he tries in his promises
also, what we have shown he does with considerable effect in
his precepta. Being instruoted hythe precepts concaming the
will of God, we are apprized of our misery, in having our hearts
so completely averse to it; and areat the same time excited to
invoke his Spirit, that we may be directed by him into the
right way. But because our sluggishness is not sufficiently
roused by the precepta, God adds his promises, to allure us by
their sweetness to the love of his commands. Now, in propor-
tion to our increased love of righteousness will be the increase
os our fervour in soeking the grace of God. See how, in these
addresses, “If ye be willing,’' “ tf ye be obedient,” the Lord
neither attributes to us an unlimited power to will and to obey,
nor yet mocks us on account of our impotence.

XI. The third class of arguments also has a great affinity
with the preceding. For they produce passages in which God
reproaches an ungrateful people, that it was wholly owing to
their own fault that they did not receive blessings of all kinds
from his indulgent hand. Of this kind are the following pas·
sagas: “ The Amalekites and the Ganaanites are there before
you, and ye shall fall by the sword3 because ye are turned
away from the Lord. ” (u) “ Because 1 called you, but ye an·
swered not, therefore will 1 do unto this house as 1 have done

(a) Numb. xiv. 43.
