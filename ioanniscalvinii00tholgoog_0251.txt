avarice, so in this he forbids falsehood; of which there are two
branchos, as we have before observed. For either we trans·
gress against the reputatiou oi our neighbours by ¹maIIgnity aud
perverse detraction, or by salsehood and sometimes by obloquy
we injure their interests. It is immaterial whether we sup·
pose the testimony here designed to be solemn and judicial, or
a common one, which is delivered iu private conversations.
For we must always recur to this maxim-that, oi each oi the
separate kinds os vices, one species is proposed as an example,
to which the rest may be reserred3 and that, in general, the
species selected is that in which the turpitude oi the vice is
most conspicuous. Itis proper, however, to extend it more ’
generally to calumnies and detraction, by which our neigh-
bours are unjustly harassed3 because falsehood in a forensic

’ testimony is always attended with perjury. But perjury, being

a profanation and violation os the name of God, has already
been sufficiently condemned in the third commandment. Where-
fore the legitimate observance of this preceptis, that our tongue,
by asserting the truth, ought to serve both the reputation and
the profit of our neighbours. 'Phe equity of this is sels-evident.
For il a good name be more precious than any treasures what·
ever, a man sustaIns as great an lnjury when he is deprived of
the integrity of his character, as when he is despoiled os his
wealth. And in plundering his substance, there is sometimes
as much effected by false testimony, as by the hands of vi·
olence.

XLVIII. Nevertheless, it is wonderful with what supine
security this precept is generally transgressed, so that few per·
sons can be found, who are not notoriously subject to this
malady; we are so fascinated with the malignaut pleasure oi
examining and detecting the saults of others. Nor should we
suppose it to be a sufficient excuse, thatin many cases we can·
not be charged with salsehood. For he who forbids the cha·
racter of our brother to be bespattered with salsehood, wills
also that as sar as the truth will permit, it be preserved lm·
maculate. For although he only guarda it agaInst salsehood,
he thereby suggests that it is committed to his charge. But
this should be sufficient to induce us to defend the fair cha-
racter oi our neighbour-that God concerns himself in its
protection. Wherefore detraction is, without doubt, universal-
ly condemned. Now, by detraction we mean, not reproof‚
thch is given from a motiva os correction, not accusation or
judieial denunciation, by which recompense is demanded sor
an injury; not public reprehension, which tends to strike ter-
ror iuto other offenders; not a discovery to them whose sasety
depends on their being previously warned, that they may not
be endangered through ignorance; but odious crimination,
