Mastar, in a parable, as in a picture, has presented us with an err-
ample of genuine humility. For he introduces epublicau, who,
“standing afar ofl, would not list up ιο much as his eyes unto
heaven, but smote upon his brcast, saying, God be mercisul ιο
me a sinner.” (s) We must not conclude these circumstances

evidences of the disposition os his heart. Το him our Lord
opposes aPharisee, who said, “ God, Ι thanlt thee that Ι arn not
as other men are, extentionem, unjust, adulterarant even as this
publicsn. 1 fast twice in the weelr, 1 give tithes of all that I
possess.’' He openly consessas the righteousness which he
has, ιο be the gift os God; but because he confides iu his being
righteous, he departs from the presence of God unacceptable
and hateful to him. 'I'he publican, aclrnowledging his Iniquity,
is justified. Hence we may see how very pleasiug our humi·
lintion is iu the sight of God; so that the henrt is not open sor
the reception of his marey unless it be divested ol all idea os
its own dignity. When this notion has occupied the mind, it
precludes the admission of Divine mercy. 'Phat no one might
have any doubt os this, Christ was sent by his Father into the
world with a commission, “ to preach good tidings nuto the
meelr3 to biud up the broken-hearted; to proclaim liberty to
the captIves, aud the opening os the prison to them that arc
bound ; to comfort all that moum3 to give unto them beauty
for asheS, the oil os joy for mourning, the garment of praise sor
the spirit of heaviness.” (ι) In pursuance of this commissiou‚
he iuvites to a participation os his benefits none but those who
“labour and are heavy laden.'' (n) Audin another place he
says, “ I arn not come ιο call the righteous, but smners ιο re-
pentance.” (o)

VIII. Therefore, it we would obey the call os Christ, let us
dismiss all arrogance aud carelessness from our miuds. 'I'he
former arises from a soolish persuasiones our own righteous·
uess, when a man supposes himself to be possessed of arry thing,
the merit of which can recommend him to God; the latter may
exist without any consideration os works. For multitudes os
sinnars, inebriated with crimiual pleasures, and forgetful os the
Diviue jndgment, are in a state, as it were, os lethargic insensi-
bility, so that they never aspire aster the mercy which is offered
to them. But it is equally necessary sor us to shake off such
stupidity, aud to reject all confidence in oursalvcs, iu order that,
being sreed from every iucumbrance, we may hasten to Christ,
all destitute aud huugry, to be filled with his blessings. For
we shall never have sufficient confidence in him, unless
