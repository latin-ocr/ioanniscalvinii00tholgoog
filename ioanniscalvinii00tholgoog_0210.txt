CHAPTER VIII.

AN nxrosmou OF THE MORAL ΒΝ.

Hans I think it will not be foreign to our subject to intro-
duce the ten precepts os the law, with a brief exposition of
them. For this will more clearly evInce what l have suggest·
ed, that the service which God has once prescribed always
remains in sull force3 and will also furnish us with a confirma·
tion of the second remark, that the Jews not only learned frorn
it the nature of true piety, but when they saw their inability
to observa it, were led by the sear os its sentence, though not
without reluctance, to the Mediator. Now, in giving a sum·
mary os those things which are requisita to the true knowledge
of God, we have shown that we can form no conceptione os his
greatness, but his majesty immediately discovers itself to ua, to
constrain usto worship him. In the knowledge of ourselves,
we have laid down this as a principal article, that being divest-
ed of all opinion os our own strength, and confidence in our
own righteousness‚ and, on the other hand, discouraged and
depressed bya consciousness of our poverty, we should leam
true humility and selsdejection. The Lord accomplishes both
these things ln his law, where, in the first place, claiming to
himself the legitimate authority to command, he calls us to
revere his DivInity, and prescribes the parts os which this re·
verence consists; and in the next place, promulgating the rule
of his righteousness‚ (the rectitudo of which, our nature, being
depraved and perverted, perpetually opposes3 and srom the per·
sectiones which, our ability, through its indolence and imbe-
cility towards that which is good, is at a great distance‚) he
convicts us both os impotence and of unrighteousness. More·
over, the internal law, which has before been said to be ln-
scribed and as it were engraven on the hearts os all men, sug-
gests to us in some measure the same things which are to be
learned from the two tables. For our conscience does not
permit us to sleep in perpetual msensibility, but is an internal
witness and monitor of the duties we owe to God, shows us
the difference between good and evil, and so accuses us when
we deviato srom our duty. But man, involved as he is ina
cloud of errors, scarcely obtains from this law of nature the
smallest idea os what worship is accepted by God3 bnt is cer-
tainly at an Immense distance from a right understanding of it.
Resides, heis so elated with arrogance and arnbition, and so
bliuded with sels-love, that he camrot yet take a vlew of hirn-
