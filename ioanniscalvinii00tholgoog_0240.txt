it is given to us without any shadows; first, in order that
during our whole life we should meditate on a perpetual rest
from our own works, that the Lord may operate within us by
his Spirit3 secondly, that every man, whenever he has leisurc,
should diligently exercise himself iu private in pious reflections
on the works os God, and also that wc should at the same time
observo the legitimare order of the Church, appointed for tha
hearing os the word, sor the administration of the sacramenta,
and for public prayer3 thirdly, that we should not unkindly
oppress those who are subject to us. Thus vanish all the
dreams of falso prophets, who in past ages have infected the
people with a Jewish notion, affirming that nothing but the
ceremonial part of this commaudment, which, according to them,
is the appointment of the seventh day, hasbeen abrogated, but
that the moral part os it, that is, the observance of one day iu
seven, still remeius But this is only changing the day in con·
tenrpt of the Jews, while they retain the same opinion of the holi-
ness of a day; for on this principle the same mysterious significa-
tion would still be attributed to particular days, which they
formerly obtained among the Jews And indeed we see what
advantages have arisen from such a sentiment. For those who
adhere to it, sar exceed the Jews in a gross, carnal, and supersti-
tious observance of the sabbath, so that the reproofs, which
we find in Isaiah, are equally applicable to them iu the present
age, as to those whom the Prophet reproved in his time. But
the principal thing to be remembered is the general doctrine3
that, lest religion decay or languish among us, sacred assem·
blies ought diligently to be held, aud that we ought to use

XXXV. 'Phe end of this precept is, that since the Lord
God desires the preservation of the order hc has appointed, the
degrees of preeminence fixed by him ought to bc inviolably
preserved. The sum of it, therefore, will be, that we should
reverence them whom God has exalted to any authority over
us, and should render them honour, obedience, and gratitudo.
Whence follows a prohibition to derogare from their dignity by
contempt, obstinacy‚ or ingratitudo. For in the Scriptura the
word “ honour ’' has an extensive signification; as, when the
Apostle directs that “the elders who rule woll be counted
worthy of double honour,” (y) ha means not only that they
