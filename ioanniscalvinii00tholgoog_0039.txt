than sophistica! wrangles? so that ii the fathers were now
restored to lile, and heard this art σι’ wrmgling, which they
call speculative diviuity, they would not suspect the disputa ιο

the instances in which the authority of the fathers isinsolently
rejected by those who would be thought their dutiful children,

Nor can they gain any advantage against us by their argu·
ment nom custom; ior, ii we were compelled to submit to cue
tom, we should have to complain os the greatest injustiee.
ludeed, if the judgments of men were correct, custom should
be sought among the good. But the fact is osten very different
What appears ιο be practised by many soon obtains the force
oi a custom. And human affairs have scarcely ever been in so
good a state as for the majority to be pleased with things oi
real excellence. From the private vices os multitudes, there·
fore, has arisen public error, or rather a common agreement oi
vices, which these good men would now have ιο be received
as law. lt is evident to all who can we, that the world ia in·
undated with more than an ocean of evils, that it is overrun
with numerous destructive pests, that every thing is fast ver·
ging ιο tuin, so that we must altogether despair ol human
affairs, or vigorously and even violently oppose such immense
evils. And the remedy is rejected for no other reason, but
becaum we have been accustomed to the evils so long. But
let public error be tolerated in human society; in the king·
dom of God nothing but his eternal truth should be heard and
regarded, which no successiones years, no custom, no con·
federacy, can circumscribe. Thus lsaiah once taught the
chosen people of God: “ Say ye not, Α confederacy, to all to
whom this people shall say, A confederacy ; ” that is, that
they should not unite in the wicked consent os the people3
“nor sear their sear, norbo afraid,'’ but rather “sanctisy the
Lord os hosts,'’ that he might “ be their sear and their dread.'’ ( 1)
Now, therefore, let them, if they please, object against us past
ages and present examples; if we “ sanctify the Lord of hosts,’'
