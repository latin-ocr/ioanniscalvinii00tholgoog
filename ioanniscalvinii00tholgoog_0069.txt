Just as if the world, which is a theatre erected sor displaying
the glory of God, were its own creatori For thus writes the
same poet in another place, following the common opinion oi
the Greeks and Latius-

“ Led by meh wondcn, chare opined,
'l'hat bees have portiom o ι heaven y mind ;
Thst God penedes, end, like one common nul,
run, t'eeda, end animam the world's great whole;
Tne flocks, herde, hemis, end men, from him receive
Their vitel brecth ς ίο him cll more end lire ;

own nature, that there is one God, who governs sll natures, and
who expects us to regerd him, to direct our saith to him, to
worship and invoke him. For nothing is more preposterons
than to enjoy such splendid advantages, which proclaim within
us their divine origin, and to neglect the Author who bounti·
iully bestows thern. Now, what illustrious specimens os his
