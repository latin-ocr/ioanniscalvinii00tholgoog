Tnon and substantial wisdom principally consists of two
parts, the knowledge of God, end the knowledge of ourselves.
But, while these two branchos of knowledge are so intimately
connected, which os them precedes aud produces the other, is

the fountain-head. Our poverty conduces to a clearer display
of the infinite sulness os God. Especially, the misernhle ruiti,
into which we have been plungcd by the defection os the first
man, compels us to raise our eyes towards heaven, not only as
