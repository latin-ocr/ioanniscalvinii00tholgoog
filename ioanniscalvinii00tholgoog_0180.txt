leave them to affiiction. 1 will see whether, at some future
period, astera series of calamitas, they will remember me, and
seek my face. The departure of the Lord signifies the removal
of his word. His observing what men will do, signifies his
concealing himself in silence, and exereising thern for a season
with various afflictions. He does both to humble us the more;
for we should sooner be confounded than corrected with the
scourges of adversity, unless he rendered us docile by his spirit.
Now, when the Lord, offended, and, as it were, wearied by our
extreme obstinaey, leaves us for a time, by the removal of his
word, in which he is accustomed to manifest his presence with
us, and makes the experiment, what we shall do in his absence,
-it is falsely inserted from this, that there is some power of free
will, which he observes and provcs; since he aets in this man·
ner with no other design than to bring us to a sense and ac·
knowledgment of our own nothingness. =
XIV. They argue also from the manner of expression which
is invariably observed, both in the Scripture and in the com·
mon conversation of mankind. For good actions are called
our own, and we are said to perform what is holy and pleasing
to the Lord, as well as to commit sins. But if sins be justly
imputed to us, as proceeding from ourselves, certainly some
share ought to be, for the same reason, assigned to us also in
works of righteousness. For it would be absurd that wc
should be said to do those thingS, to the performanee of which,
being incapable of any exertion of our own, we were impelled
byGod, asso many stenes. Wheresore, though we allow the
grace of God the preeminenee, yet these expressions indicate
that our own endeavours heldat least the second place. If it
were only alleged, that good works are called our own, 1
would reply, that the bread which we pray to God to give ua,
is called onrs. What will they prove by this term, but that
what otherwise by no means belongs to us, becomes ours
through the benignity and gratuitous munificence of God?
Thevefore let thern either ridicule the same absurdity in the
Lord's prayer, orno longer esteem it ridiculous, that good
works are denominated ours, in which we have no propriety
but from the liberality of God. But there is rather more force
in what follows, that the Scriptura frequently affirms that we
ourselves worship God, work righteousness, obey the law, and
perform good works. These being the proper offices of the
understanding and will, how could they justly be referred to
the Spirit, and at the same time be attributed to us, if there
were not some union of our exertions with the grace of God?
We shall easily extricata ourselves from these objections, if we
properly consider the manner in which the Spirit of the Lord
operatas in the saints. The similitude with which they try to
