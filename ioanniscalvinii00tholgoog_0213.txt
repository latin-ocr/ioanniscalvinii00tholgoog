ae if it were not a duty. But the effect of those promises on
ue hae partly been mentioned already, and will hereafter more
clearly appear in its proper place. Suffice it at present, if we
remember and consider that the promises of the law contain no
mean recommendation of righteousness, to make it more evident
how much God is pleaeed with the observance of it 3 and that
the penal sanctione are annexed, to render unrightcoueness more
execrable, lest the einner, arnidst the fascinatione of ein, should
forget that the judgment of the [sigislator awaits him.

V. Now, since the Lord‚ when about to delivcr a rulc of
perfect righteousness, referred all the parts of it to his own will,
this shows that nothing ismore acceptable to him than obedi·
ance. This is worthy of the most diligent observation, since
the licentiousness of the human mind is so inclined to the fre·
quent invention of various services in order to merit his favour.
For this irreligione affectation of religion, which is a principle
innatc in the human mind, has betrayed iteelf in all ages, and
betrays iteelf even in the present day ; for men always take a
pleasure in contriving some way of attaining righteousness,
which is not agreeable to the Divino word. Hence, among
those which are commonly eeteemed good works, the precepts
of the law hold a very contracted station, the numberless
multitude of human inventione occupying almost the whole
space. But what was the design of Moses, unless it wasto

command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto,
nor diminish from it.'’ (i) And before, when he had declared
that thie was their wiedom aad their understanding in the sight
of other natione, that they had received statutes, and judgments,
and ceremonias, from the Lord‚ he had added, “ 'Pake heed to
thyself, and keep thy eonl diligently, leet thou forget tho
things which thine eyes have seen, and leet they depart from
thy heart all the days of thy life.'' (le) Foreseeing that the
Israelites would not rest, bnt, even after the reception of the lav,
would labour to produce new species of righteousness, foreign
from what the law requires, unless they should be rigorously
restraincd, God prononucee that his word comprehende the
perfectiori of righteousnees; and yet, though this ought most
effectually to have prevented them, they were guilty of that
very presumption which was eo expressly forbidden. But
