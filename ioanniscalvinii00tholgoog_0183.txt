it was in vain for him to meditate crimes in order to' excel his
brother in the sight of God, with whom no honour is given
but to righteousness3 secondly, that he was extremely un·
grateful for the favours God had already conferred on him,
since he could not bear his brother, even though subject to his
authority. But that we may not appear to adopt this explana-
tion, merely because the other is unfavourable to our tauers,
let us admit that God spalre concerning sin. lf it be so, then
what the Lord there declares, is either promised or commanded
by him. lf it be a command, we have already demonstrated
that it affords no proof of the power of men: if it be a promise,
where is the completion of the promise, seeing that Cain fell
under the dominion of sin, over which hc ought to have pre·
vailcd? They will say, that the promise includes a tacit con·
ditiones though it had been declared to him that he should
obtain the victory if he would contend for it; but who can
admit these subterfuges? For if this dominion be referred to
sin, the speech is doubtless a command, expressive, not of our
ability, but of our duty, which remains our duty even though
it exceed our ability. But the subject itself, and grammatical
propriety, require a comparison to be made between Cain and
Abel; in which the elder brothor would not have been placed
below the younger, if he had not degraded himself by his own
wickedness.

XVII. They adduce also the testimony of the Apostle, who
says, that “it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that run·
neth, but of God that ·showeth mercy3 ’'(n) whence they
conclude, that there is something in the will and endeavour,
which, though ineffectual of itself, is rendered successful by
the assistance of the Divina mercy. But if they would soberly
examine the subject there treated by Paul, they would not so
inconsiderately pervert this passage. I know that they can
allege the suffrages of Origen and Jerome in defence of their
exposition3 and in opposition to thern, Ι could produce that of
Augustine. l3ut their opinions are of no importanoc to us if
we ean ascertain what was the meaning of Paul. He is there
reaching, that salvation is provided for them alone, whom the
Lord favours with his mercy; but that ruiu and perdition
await all those whom he has not chosen. He had shown, by
the example of Pharaoh, the condition of the reprobate; and
had confirmed the certainty of gratuitous election by the tes·
timouy of Moses: “l will have mercy on whom l will have
mercy.'' His conclusion is, that “ it is not of him that willeth,
noros him that runneth, but of God that showeth morey.'’
lf thisbe understood to im'ply that our will end endeavour are
