he does it himself by his grace.’' And this is the observation to
which he himself assigna the fifth place in his enumeratiou of
Ticonius's rules of Christian doctrine, that we should make a
proper distinction between the law and the promises, or be-
tween the commandments and grace. This may suffice, in
answer to those who from the precepts infer an ability in man
to obey them, that they may destroy the grace of God, by
which those very precepts are fulfilled. The precepts os the
second class arc simple, enjoining on us the worship of God,
’ constant submission to his will, observance of his commands‚
aud adherence to his doctrine. But there are innumerable pas-
sages, which prove that the highest degree of righteousuess,
sanctity, piety, and purity, capable of being attained, is his
own gift. Of the third class is that exhortation of Paul and
Barnabas to the faithful, mentioned by Lulre, “to continue in
the grace of God.'' (d) But whence the grace of perseverance
should be sought, the same Apostle informs us, when he says,
“ Finally, my brethren, be strong iu the hordl’ (e) ln another
place he cautious us to “grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
whereby we are sealed unto the day of redempticn.'' (s) But
because what he there requires could not be performed by men,
he prays for the Thessaloniaus, “that our God would count
them worthy of this calling, aud fulfil all the good pleasure
of his goodness, and the work of faith with power.” (g)
Thus, also, in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, treating
of alms, he frequently commenda their benevolent and pious
dispositi0n3 (Ιι) yet a little after he gives thanks to God
sor having inclined the heart of Titus to “accept ’' or un·
dertake “the exhortation.’' If Titus could not even use
his own tongue to exhort others without having been prompted
by God, how should others have been inclined to act, unless
God himself had directed their hearts?

IX. Our more subtle adversaries cavil at all these testimo·
nies, because there is no impediment, they say, that prevents
our exerting our own ability, and God assisting our weak ef-
forts. They adduce also passages from the Propheta, where
the accomplishment of our conversiou seems to be divided
equally between God andus. “Turn ye unto me, and I will
turn unto you.’' (i) What assistance we receive from the Lord
has already been shown, and needs not to be repeated here.
1 wish only this single point to be conceded to me, that it is iu
vain to infer our possession of ability to sulfil the law from
God’s command to usto obey it; since it is evident, that for
the performance of all the Divina precepts, the grace of the
