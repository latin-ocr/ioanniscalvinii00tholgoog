ministration oi the sacramema Theyare not satisfied unless the
Ohurch can always be pointed out with the linger. But how
often among the Jewish people was it so diserganized‚ es to
have no visible form lest? What splendid torm do we suppose

How long, aiter the coming of Christ, did it romain without
any external form? How often, since that time, have wara,
seditione, and heresies, opmessed and totally obscured it? lt
they had lived at that period, would they have believed that
any Ohurch existed? Yet Elias was informed that there
were “leit seven thousand '’ who had “ not bowed the ltnee
