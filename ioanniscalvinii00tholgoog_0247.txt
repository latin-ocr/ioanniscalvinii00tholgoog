nication, flatter himself, as though he could not be charged
with unchastity, while his beart at the same time is inflamed
with libidinous desire. For Paul defines chastity to consist
in sanctity of mind connected with purity of body. “The
uumarried woman,'’ he says, “careth sor the things of the
Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit.”(lc)
Therefore, when he gives a reason to confirm the preceding in-
junction, he does not content himself with sayiug that it is
better for a man to marry than to pollute himself with the so-
ciety of a harlot, but affirms that “it is better to marry than to
burn.’'(l) ·

XLIV. Now, if married persons are satisfied that their so·
ciety is attended with the blessing of the Lord, they are there-
by admonished that it must not be contaminated by libidinous
and dissolute intemperance. For if the honour of marriage
conceals the shame of incontinence, it ought not on that ac-
count to be made an incitement to it. Wherefore let it not be
supposed by married persons that all things are lawsul to thern.
Every man should observa sobriety towards his wife, and every
wife, reciprocally, towards her husband3 eonducting themselves
in such a manner as to do nothing unbecoming the decorum
and temperance of marriage. For thus ought marriage con-
tracted in the Lord to be regulated by moderatiori aud modesty,
and not to break out into the vilest lasciviousness. Such sen·
nuality has been stigmatized by Ambrose with a severe, but not
unmerited censure, when he calls those who in their conjugal
intercourse have no regard to modesty or decorum, the adul-
terers of their own wives. Lastly, let us consider who the Le-
gislator is, by whom adultery is here condemned. lt is no other
than he who ought to have the entire possessiones us, and·
justly requires the whole of our spirit, soul, and body. 'Phere-
fore, when hc prohibits us from committing adultery, he at the
same time sorbids us, either by lasciviously ornamenting our
persons, or by obscene gesticulatione, or by impure expressions,
insidiously to attack the chastity of others. For there is much
reason in the address of Archelaus to a young man clothed in
an immoderately effeminate and delicate manner, that it was
immaterial in what part he was immodest, with respect to God,
who abominates all contamination, in whatever part it may dis-
cover itself, either of soul or of body. And that there may be
no doubt on the subject, let us remember that God here recom-
mends chastity. If the Lord requires chastity of us, he con-
demns every thing contrary to it. Wherefore, if we aspiro to
obedience, neither let our mind internally burn with depravcd
concupiscence, nor let our eyes wauton into corrupt affections,
