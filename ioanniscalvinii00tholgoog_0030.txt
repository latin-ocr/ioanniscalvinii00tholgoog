rnnpatiou sno ho is deceived who expects lesting prosperity
in that kingdom which is not ruled by the sceptre of God, that
is, his holy word3 for that heavenly oraclo cannot t‘ail, which
declares that “where there is no vision, the people perish'' (o)
Nor should you be seduced from this prusuit by a contemptos

our meonness. We are fully conscious to ourselves how very
mean and object we are, being miserable sinners before God,
sud accounted most despicable by men3 being (il you plesse)
the refuse ol the world, -deserving of the vilest appellatione
that can be found3 so that nothing remeius sor us to glory in
before God, but his mercy alone, by which, without any merit
of oure, we have been admitted to the hope of etemal selva·
tion, aud before men nothing but our wealmess, the slightest
wnfession οἰ whichis eswemed by them as the greatest dis·

be said, to excite your attention, or st least to prepare your
mind for this perusel. Paul’s direction, that every prophecy
be [remed “according to the arralogy of saith,’' (c) has fixed au
invariable standard by which all interpretation of Scripture
ought to be tried. If our principles be examined by this rulo
ol saith, the victory is ours. For what is more consistent with
saith than to ucknowledge ourselves naked of all virtue, that
we may be clothed by God; empty os all good, thet we may
