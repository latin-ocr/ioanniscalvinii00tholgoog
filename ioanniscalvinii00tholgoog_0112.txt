again polluted with idols. For Terah and Nachor, before the
birth of Abraham, were worshippers ol false gods, as is asserted
by Joshua (z) Since the posterity of Shem so speedily de·
genamad, what opinion must we entertain of the descendants
of Ham, who had already been cursed in their father? The
true state of the case is, that the mind of man, being full of
pride arrd temerity, dares to conceive of God according to its
own standard; and, being sunlr in stupidity, and immersed in
profound ignorancs, imagines a vain and ridiculous phantom
instead of God. These evils are followed by another3 men
attempt to express in the work of their hands such a deity as¹
they have imagined in their minds. The mind then begets
the idol, arrd the hand brings it forth. The example of the
israelites proves this to have been the origin of idolatry,
namely, that men believe not God to be among them, unless
he exhibit some external signs os his presence. “As for this
MoseS,’' they said, “ we wot not what is become of him; melre
ns gods which shall go before us.'' (a) They knew, indeed,
that there was a God, whose power they had experienced in
so many miracles; but they had no confidencs in his being
present with them, unless they could see some corporeal sym·
bol of his countenance, as a testimony of their Divina Guide.
They wished, therefore, to understand, from the image going
before them, that God was the leader of their march. Daily

foolishly gratified, as an image of God. ln almost all ages,
from the creation of the world, in obedience to this stupid
propensity, men have erected visible representations, in which
they believed God to be presented to their carnal eyes.

IX. Such an invention is immediately attended with adora·
tion3 for when men supposed that they saw God in images,
they also worshipped him in them. At length, both their eyes
and their minds being wholly confined to them, they began
to grow more stupid, and to admire them, as though they pos·
sessed some inherent divinity. Now, it is plain that men did
not rnsh into the worship of images, till they had imbibed
some very gross opinion respecting them ; not, indeed, that they
believed them to be gods, bnt they imagined that something
of Divinity resided in them. When yon prostrate yourself,
therefore, in adoration of an image, whether you suppose it to
represent God or a creature, you are already fascinated with
