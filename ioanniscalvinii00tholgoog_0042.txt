tude ol men in sortirer ages3 lor, in consequence ol their rosist-
anco tohis nuth, and extinction ol the light he had given
mern, he permitted them to be blindad by sensa, deludad by
absrnd lalsahoods, and immerged in prosound darkness, so that
thare was no appearance ol the true Church left ; yet, at the same
time, in the midst of darkness and errors, he preserved his scet-
tcred and concealed peoplc from total destruction. Nor is this

to ba wondered at; for he knew how to save in all the con·
ltrsion ol Babylon, and the darm ol the fiery fornace. But how
dangerous it is to estimato the form os the Ohrnoh by 1 know
not what vain pomp, which they contend sor, Ishall rather
brielly suggest than state at large, lest 1 should protract this
(limatura to an excessivo length. 'Phe Pope, they say, who
holds tho Apostolic see, and the bishops anointed and conse-
crated by him, provided they ara equipped with mitres and
crosiers, represent the Choreb, and ought to be considered as

on the sida of Micaiah, solitary and despised as he was, and
out ol his mouth proceeded the truth. Did not those propheta
exhibit both the name and appearance of the Church, who
with united violence rose up against Jeramiah, and threatened
and boasted, “the law shall not perish from the priest, nor
connsel from the wisc, nor the word from the prophet ’' i (1)
Jeremiah is sent singly against tha whole multitude ol propheta,
with a denunciaticn from the Lord, that the “ law shall perish
from the priest, ccrmsel from the wise, and the word from the
prophet.” (a) And was there not the like external respecta·
bility in the council convened by the chief priests, scribes, and
Pharisees, to consult about putting Christ to death? (ro) Now,
let them go and adhere to the externa} appearance, and thareby
make Christ and all the prophete schismatics, and, on the other
