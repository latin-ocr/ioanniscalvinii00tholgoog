no other, abundantly appears from another declaration, which
he had made just before: “As by one man’s disobedienca
many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall
many be made righteous.'’ (r) What is placing our righteous·
ness in the obedienee of Christ, but asserting, that we are
accounted righteous only because his obedienee is accepted for
usas if it were our own? Wherefore Ambrose appears to me
to have very beautifully exemplified this righteousness in the
benediction of Jacob3 that as he, who had on his own account
no claim to the privileges of primogenitura, being concealed in
his brother’s habit, and invested with his garment, which dif-
fuseda most excellent odour, insinuated himself into the favour
of his father, that he might receive the benediction to his own
advantage, under the character of another, so we shelter our·
selves under the precious purity of Christ our elder brother, that
we may obtain the testimony of righteousness in the sight of
God. The words of Ambrose are, “That Isaac smelled the
odour of the garments, perhaps indicates, that we are justified
not by works, but by faith; since the infimrity of the flesh is
an impediment to works, bnt the brightness of saith, which
merite the pardon of sin, conceals the error of our actions.'' And
such is indeed the real fact, for that we may appear before the
face of God to salvation, it is necessary forus to be persumed
with his fragrance, and to have all our deformities concealed
and absorbed in his perfectiori. ⁶

Triones it appears, from the plainest testimonias that all
these things are strictly true, yet we shall not clearly discover
how necessary they are, till we shall have taken a view of
what ought to be the foundation of all this argument. Iu the
first place, therefore, wc should reflect that we are not treating
of the righteousness of a human court, but of that of the hea-
venly tribunal; in order that we may not apply any diminutive
standard of our own, to estimate the integrity os conduct re-
quired to satisfy the Divine justice. But it is wonderful, with
what temerity and presumption this is commonly decided3 and it
is even observable, that no men give us more confident or pom·
pous declamatione concaming the righteousness of works, than
