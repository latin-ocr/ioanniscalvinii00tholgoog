was clearly manifested, the Word must have existed long before.
But if any oue inquires, how long, he will find no beginning.
For he limits no certain period of time, when he himself says,
“0 Father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the
glory which lhad with thee before the world was.” (r) Nor
is this omitted by John; for, before he descende to the creation
of the world, he declares that the Word “was in the beginning
with God.'' (s) We therefore conclude again, that the Word,
conceived of God before time began, perpetually remained with
him, which proves his eternity, his true essence, and his divinity.

IX. Though l advert not yet to the person of the Mediator,
but defer it to that part of the worlr which will relate to re-
demption, yet, since it ought, without controversy, to be believed
by all, that Christ is the very same Word clothed iu flesh, any
testimonies which essert the Deity of Christ, will be very prop-
erly introduced here. When it is said, in the forty·fifth Psalm,
“Thy throne, Ο God, is for ever aad ever,'' the Jews endeav-
our to evade its force, by pleading that the name Elohim is ap·
plicable also to angele, and to men of dignity and power. But
there cannot be found in the Scriptura a similar passage, which
erects au etemal throne for a creature ; for he is not merely
called God, but is also declared to possess an etemal dominion.
Resides, this title is never given to a creature, without some
addition, as when it is said that Moses should be “a god to
Pharaoh.” (t) Some read it in the genitive case, “Thy throne
is of God,” which is extremely insipid. lconfess, indeed, that
what is eminently and singularly excellent, is frequently called
Divine3 but it sufficiently appears from the context, that such
a meaning would be uncouth and forced, and totally inappli·
cable here. But, if their perverseness refuse to yield this point,
there certainly isne obscurity in lsaiah, where he introduces
Christ as God, and as orowned with supreme power, which is
the prerogative of God alone. “His name,'’ says he, “shall be
called the Mighty God, the Father of etemity,'’ ee. (a) Here
also the Jews object, and invert the reading of the passage in
this manner: “This is the name by which the mighty God,
the Father of etemity, shall eall him,'’ dec-3 so that they
would leave the Son only the title of Prinee of peace. But to
what purpose would so many epithets be accumulated in this
passage on God the Father, when the design of the prophet is
to distinguish Christ by such eminent characters as may estab-
lish our saith in him? Wherefore, there can be no doubt that
he is there denominated the Mighty God, just as, a little before,
he is called Immarruel. But nothing can be required plainer
than a passage in Jeremiah, that this should be the name
