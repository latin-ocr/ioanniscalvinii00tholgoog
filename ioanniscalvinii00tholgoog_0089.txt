teries of the kingdom of heaven should be communicated, for
the most part, in a humble andoontemptible style ; lest, if they
had been illustrated with more of the splendour of eloquence,
the impious might cavil that their triumph is only the triumph
of eloquente. Now, since that uncultivated end almost rude
simplicity procures itself more reverence than all the greces
of rhetoric, what opinion can we form, but that the force of
truth iu the sacred Scriptura is too powerful to need the as-
sistance of verbal arti Justly, therefore, does the apostle
argue that the faith of the Corinthiam was founded, “not in
the wisdom of men, but in the power of God,¹’ because his
preaching among them was, “not with enticing wmds of
man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of
power.'’ (a) For the truth is vindicated from every doubt,
when, unassisted by foreign aid, it is sufficient for its own
support. But that this is the peculiar property of the Scriptura,
appears from the insufficiency of any human compositione,
however artificially polished, to make an equal impression on
our minds. Read Demosthenes or Oicer03 read Plato, Aris·
totle, or any others of that class3 Igrant that you will be at·
tracted, delighted‚ moved, and enraptured by them in a sur·
prising manner ; but if, after reading them, you turn to the
pemsal of the sacred volume, whether you are willing or un·
willing, it will effect you so powerfully, it will so penetrate
your beart, and impress itself so strongly on your mind, that,
compared with its energetic influence, the beauties of rhetori-
cians and philosophers will almost entirely disappear; so that
it is easy to perceive something divine in the sacred Scripturas,
which far surpasses the highest attainments and ornaments of
human industry.

Il. I grant, indeed, that the diction of some of the prophete
is neat and elegant, aud even splendid; so that they are not
inferior in eloquence to the heathen writers. And by such
examples the Holy Spirit hath been pleased to show, that he
was not deficient in eloquence, though elsewhere he hath used
a rude and hemely style. But whether we read David, lsaiah,
and others that resemble them, who have a sweet and pleasant
flow of words, or Amos the herdsman, Jeremiah, and Zecha·
riah, whose rougher lauguage savours of ursticity, — that majesty
of the Spirit, which 1 have mentioned, is every where con·
spicuous. lam not ignorant that Satan in many things im-
itates God, in order that, by the sallacious resemblance, he
may more easily insinuate himself into tho minds of the sim·

even barbarous language, the most impious errors, by which
