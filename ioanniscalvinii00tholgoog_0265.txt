IV. This likewise evinces the error of those who never
make any other comparison between the Law and the Gospel,
than between the merit of works and the gratuitous imputation
of righteousness. 'I'his antithesis, I grant, is by no means to
be rejected ; because Paul by the word hrw frequently intends
the rule of a righteous life, iu which God requires of us what
we owe to him, affording us no hope of life, unless we fulfil
every part of it, and, on the contrary, annexing a curse if we

are accepted by God through grace, and are accounted righteous
through his pardon of our sins, because the observance of the
law, to which the reward is promised, is not to be found in any
man. Paul, therefore, justly represents the righteousnessof the
law and that of the gospel as opposed to each other. But the

promises of the law, and to connect the body with the shadows.
For when Christ says that “the law and the prophete were
until John,” he does not abendon the fathers to the curse
which the slaves of the law cannot escape; he rather impliee
that they were only initiated in the rudiments of religion, so
that they remained far below the sublimity of the evangelieal
doctrine. Wherefore, when Paul calls the gospel ‘⁶ the power
of God unto salvation to every one that believeth,'' he after·
wards adds that it is “witnessed by the law and the pro-
phets.” (l) But at the end of the same Epistle, although he
asserto that the preaching of Jesus Christ is “ the revelation of
the mystery which was kept secret since the world began,” he
qualifies this sentiment with the following explication -that it
“is now made manifest, and by the Scripturas of the prophets
made known to all nations.’'(m) Hence we conclude, that
when mention is made of the whole law, the gospel differs
from it only with respect toa clear manifestationy but on ac·
count of the inestimable plenitude of grace, which has been
displayed to us in Christ, the celestial kingdom of God is justly
said to have been erected in the earth at his advent.

V. Now, John was placed between the Law and the Gospel,
holding an intermediate office connected with both. For
though, in calling Christ “ the Lamb of God ’' and “the victim
for the expietion of sins,” (n) he preached the substance of the
gospel ; yet, because he did not clearly express that incompara-
ble power and glory which afterwards appeared in his resur·
rection, Christ affirma that he is not equal to the Apostles.
This is his meaning in the following words: “Among them
