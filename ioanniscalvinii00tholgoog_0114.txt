displayed hispower in images. Nevertheless, the Jews were
persuaded that, under such images, thoy worshipped the
eternal God, theone true Lord 01 heaven and earth; and the
heathen, that they worshipped their 10100 gods, whom they
pretended to be inhabitants 01 heaven.

X. Those who deny that this has been done in time past,
and even within our own remembrance, essert an impudent
salsehood. For why do they prostrate themselves before images?
And when about to pray, why do they turn themselves to-
wards them, as towards the ears 01 God? For it is true, as Au·
guatino says, (d) “ That no man prays or worships thuS, look·
ing on an image, who is not impressed withan opinion that
he shall be heard by it, anda hope that it will do sor him as
he desires.’' Why is there so great a difference between im-
ages 01 the same god, that one is passed by with little 01110
respect, and another is honoured in the most solemn manner?
Why do they fatigue themselves with votive pilgrimoges, in
going to see irnoges resembling those which they haveat home?
Why do they at this day light, even to slaughter and destruction,
in desence 01 them, as 01 their country and religion, so that they
could part with the only true God more easily than with their
idols? Yet Iam not here enumeratingthe gross errore 01 the
vulgar, which are almost infinite, and occupy nearly the hearts
01 011; I only relate what they themselves allcge, when they
are most anxious to exculpate themselves from idolatry. “We
never,’' say they, “eall them our gods.'’ Nor did the Jews or
heathen in ancient times call thern their gods3 and yet the
Prophets, in all their writings, were constantly accusing them
01 somication with wood and stone, only 011 account 01 such
things as are daily practised by those who wish to be thought
Christians; that is, sor worshipping God, by corporeal adoration
before figures 01 wood 01 stone.

XI. lam neither ignorant, nor desirous os concealing, that
they evade the charge by a more subtle distinction, which will
soon be noticed more at large. They pretend that the rever·
01100 which they pay to images is aristolociae, (service 01 im·
agea) but deny that it is triumtarpaa (worship 01 images.)
For in this manner they express themselves, when they main·
tain, that the reverence which they call dulia, may be given
to statues or picturas, without injury to God. They consider
themselves, therefore, liable to no blame, while they are only
the servants 01 their idols, and not worshippers 01 1110111; as
though worship were not rather inferior to service. And yet,
while they seelr to shelter themselves under a Greek term,
they contradict themselves in the most childish manner. For
