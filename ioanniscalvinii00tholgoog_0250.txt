Let juniors revere old age, since the Lord has designed that
age to be honourable. Let old men, by their prudence and
superior experience, guide tbe imbecility of youth 3 not teasing
them with sharp and clamorous invectives, but tempering se·
verity with mildness and affability. Let servants show them·
selves obedient and diligent in the service os their masters,
and that not only in appearance, but from the beart, as sarving

tended tbe following words as an exposition of this commende
“ Thou shalt not raise a false repert: put not thine hand with
the wicked to be an unrigbteous witness.'’ Again: “Keep
thee far from a salse matter.'' (m) In another place also he
not only forbids us to practise backbiting and tale-bearing
among the people, but probibits every man from deceiving bis
