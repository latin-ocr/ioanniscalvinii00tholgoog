11 is easy to infer what l have already remarked, that whatever
good is in the human will, is the work of plue grace. In the

same sense he elsewhere pronounces that it is “God which
worketh all iu all.'' (i) For in that place he is not discussing
the govemrnent of the universe, but asserting that the praise of
all the excellences found in the faithful belongs to God alone.
And by using the word “all,” he certainly makes God the
author of spiritual life from its commencement even to its ter-
mination. This is the same as he had before taught in other
words, declaring that the faithful are “ of God in Christ 3 '’ (lc)
where he evidently intends the new creation, by which what
belonged to our common nature is abolished. For we must
here understand an irnplied contrast between Adam and Christ,
which he states more plainly in another place, where he
teaohes that “we are the workmanship of God, created in
Christ Jesus unto good workS, which God hath before ordained
that we should walk in them.'' (l) For by this argument he
desigus to prove that our salvation is gratuitous, because the
beginning of all good is from the second creatiou, which we
obtain iu Christ. Now, if wc possessed any ability, though ever
so small, we should also have some portion of merit. But to
annihilata all our pretensions, he argues that we have merited
nothing, because “we are created in Christ Jcsus unto good
works, which God hath before ordained ; '' in which expressions
he again significs that all the parts of good works, oven from
the first inclination of the mind, are entirely from God. For
this reason the Psalmist, after having said that “ he (God) hath
made us,’' that there may be no division of the work, immedi-
ately subjoins, “and not we ourselves.'' (m) That he speaks
of regeneration, which is the commencement of the spiritual
life, is evidcnt from the context, where it follows immediately
after, that “we are his people, and the sheep of his pastiue.”
We see, then, that not content with having simply attributed to
God the praise of our salvation, he expressly excludes us from
all fellowship with him; as though he would say, that man
has not even the smallest particle remaining m which he can
glory, because all is of God.

vn. But there may be some, who will concede that the
will, being, of its own spontaneous inclination, averse to what is
good, is converted solely by the power of the Lord; yet in
such a manner, that being previously prepared, it has also its
own share in the work ; that grace, as Augustine teaches, pre·
cedes every good work, the will following grace, not leading it,
being its companion, not its guida. This unobjectionable ob·
servation of that holy man, Peter Lombard preposterously
