the passages, which they abuse in their opposition to us, when
properly classed and distributed, centre ina very few topics,
one answer will be sufficient for many of them; it will not be
necessary to dwcll on a particular explicatior] of each. Their
principal argument they derive from the precepts3 which they
suppose to be so proportioned to our ability, that whatever they
cau be proved to require, it necessarily follows we are capable
of performing. They proceed, therefore, to a particular detail
of thern, and by them measure the extent of our strength.
Either, say they, God mocks us, when he commands holiness,
piety, obedience, chastity, love, aud meekuess, and when he
forbids impurity, idolatry, unchastity, anger, robbery, pride,
and the like ; or he requires only such things as we have
power to perform. Now, almost all the precepts which they
collect, may be distributed into three classes. Some require
the first conversion to God; others simply relate to the observa·
tion of the law3 others enjoin perseverance in the grace of
God already received. Let us first speak of thern all in general,
and then proceed to the particulare. To represent the ability
of man as coextensive with the precepts of the Divino law, has
indeed for along time not been unusual, aud has some appear-
ance of plausibility3 but it has proceeded from the grossest
ignorance of the law. For those who think it an enormous
crime to say that the observationes the law is impossible,
insist on this very cogent argument, that otherwise the law
was given in vein. For they argue just as if Paul hed never
said any thing concaming the lav. But, pray, what is the
meaning of these expressions-“ The law was added because
of transgressions;'’ “by the law is the knowledge of sin;’'
“the law worketh wrath ; '’ “the law entered that the offence
might abound? '' (w) Do they imply a necessity of its being
limited to our ability, that it might uot be given in vain? Do
they not rather show that it was placed far beyond our ability,
in order to convince us of our impotenee? According to the
definitiones the same Apostle, “ the end of the commandment
is charity.’'(c) But when he wishes the minda of the 'Phes-
salonians to “abeund in love,’' (y) hs plainly acknowledges
that the law sounds in our ears in vain, unless God inspire the
principles of it into our hearts.

Vll. Indeed, if the Scripture taught only that the law is tlte
rule of life, to which our conduct ought to be conformed, l
would immediately accede to their opinion. But since it care·
fully and perspicuously states to us various uses of the law, it
will be best to consider the operation of the law in man accord-
ing to that exposition. As far as relates to the present argument,
