fection which nothing can alter. “ Whosoever is bom of God,”
he says, “cannot sin, for his seed remaineth in him.’' (d) For
we aee that the neutral, inefficacious impulse imagined by the
sophista, which every one would be at liberty ιο obey or resist,
is evidently excluded, where it is asserted that God gives a
constancy that is effectual to perseverance.

ΧΙ. Conceming perseverance there would have been no
doubt that it ought to be esteemed the gratuitous gift of God,
had it not been for the prevalence of a pestilent error, that it is
dispensed according to the merit of men, in proportion to the
gratitudo which each person has discovered for the grace be·
stowed on him. But as that opinion arose from the supposition
that it was at our own option to reject or accept the offered
grace of God, this notion being exploded, tha other falls of
course. Though here is a double error, for beside reaching
that our gratitude for the grace first bestowed on us, and our
legitimate use of that grace, are remunerated by subsequent
blessings, they add also, that now grace does not operate alone
in us, but only coiiperates with us. On the first point, we
must admit that the Lord, while he daily enriches and loads
his servants with new communications of his grace, perceiving
the work which he has begun in them grateful and accept·
able, discovers something in them which he blesses with still
greater degrees of grace. And this is implied in the following
declarations: “ Uuto every one that bath, shall be given.’'
And, “ Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been
faithful over a few things, l will make thee ruler over many
thinga” (c) But here two errors must be avoided; the legiti-
mate use of the grace first bestowed must not be said to be re·
warded with subsequent degrees of grace, as though man, by
his own industry, rendered the grace of God efficacious3 nor
must it be accounted a remuneration in such a sense as to cease
to be esteemed the free favour of God. l grant, then, that this
Divine benedictionis to be expected by the faithful, that the
better they have used tha former measrues of grace, they shall
afterwards be enriched with proportionably greater degrees of
it. But lassert that this use also is from the Lord, and that
this remuneration proceeds from his gratuitous benevolence.
They are equally awkward and unhappy in their use of the
trite distinction of operating and cooperating grace. Augustino
has used it indeed, but sostens it by a suitable definiti0n3 that
God in cooperating completos what in operating he begins, and
that it is the same grace, but derives its name from the different
mode of its efficiency. Whence it follows, that he makes no
partitiones the work between God and us, as though there
