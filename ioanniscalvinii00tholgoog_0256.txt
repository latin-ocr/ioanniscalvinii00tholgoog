LIII. Is it, then, it will be ashed, of more importance to·
wards the attainment of righteousness to live innocently with
men, than piously towards God? By no means. But because
no man fullils all the duties of charity, unless he really fear
God, we derive from those duties a proof of his piety. Be·
sides, the Lord‚ well knowing that he can receive no benefit
from us, which he also declares by the Psalmist, (a) requires
not our services for himself, but employs us in good worka
towards our neighbour. It is not without reason, then, that the
Apostle makes all the perfectiori of the saints to consist in
love ; (w) which in another place he very justly styles “the
fulfilling of the law;” adding, that “he that loveth another
hath fulfilled the law.'’(a) Again: that “all the law is ful·
filled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
as thyself.” (p) For he teaehes nothing different from what is
taught by Christ himself, when he says, “All things whatso-
ever ye would that men should do to you, do ya even so tc
them; for this is the law and the prophets.'' (z) It is certain that
in the law and the prophets, faith, and all that pertains to the
legitimare worship of God, hold the principal place, and that
love occupies an inferior station ; hut our Lord intends that the
observance of justice and equity among men is only prescribed
to us in the law, that our pious fear of him, if we really possess
any, may be proved by our actions.

LIV. Here, then, we must rest, that our life will then be
governed according to the will of God, and the prescriptions
of his law, when it is in all respecta most beneficial to our
brethren. But we do not find in the whole law one syllable,
that lays down any rule sor a man respecting those things ·
which he should practise or omit for his carnal convenience.
And surely, since men are born in such a state, that they are
entirely governed byan immoderate self-love,-apassion which,
how great soeret their departure from the truth, they always
retain, -there was no need of a law which would inflame that
love, already of itself too violent. Whence it plainly appears,
that the observance of the commandments consists not in the
love of ourselves‚ but in the love of God and of our neighbour;
that his is the best and most holy life, who lives as little as
possible to himself ; and that no man leads a worse or more
iniquitous life, than he who lives exclusively to himself, and
makes his own interest the sole object of his thoughts aud pur-
suits. Moreover, the Lord‚ in order to give us the best expres·
sion of the strength of that love which we ought to exercise
towards our neighbonrs‚ has regulated it by the standard of our
sels-lore, because there was no stronger or more vehement af-
