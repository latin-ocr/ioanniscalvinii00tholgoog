kingdom3 that hence it is plain, as we have before asserted,
that there can be no saving knowledge of God without Christ;
and consequently that from tho beginning of tho world he has
always been manifested to all the elect, that they might look
to him, and reposo all their confidence in him. In this sense
Irenaeus says that the Father, who is infinite in himself, be·
comes finite in the Son3 because he has accommodated him·
sels to our capacity, that he may not ovcrwhelm our minds
with the infinity os his glory. (lc) And fanatice, not consider·
ing this, pervert a useiul observation into an impious reverie,
aa though there were in Christ merely a portion of Deity, an
emanation from the infinite perfectiori ; whereas tho sole mean-
ing ot' that writer is, that God is apprehended in Christ, and iu
him alone. The assertion of John has been verified in all

· ages, “ Whosoever denieth the Son, the same heth not the

Father.'’(l) For though many in ancient times gloried in
being worshippers of tho Suprema Deity, the Creator of heaven
aad earth, yet, because they had no Mediator, it was impossi-
ble for them to have any real acquaintance with the mercy
of God, or persuasion that ho was their Father. Thercfore, as
they did not hold the head, that is, Christ, all their knowledge
of God was obscure and unsettled3 whence it carne to pass,
that degenerating at length into gross and vile superstitious,
,they betrayed their ignorance, like the Turks in modern
times; who, though they boast ot' having the Creator of
heaven and earth sor their God, yet only substitute an idol

grptead os the true God as long as they remain enemies to
rlst.

Fron the deductiori we have made, it' may easily be in-
ferred, that the law was superadded about sour hundred years
aster the death of Abraham, not to draw away the attention os
the choson people from Christ, but rather to keep their minds
waiting sor his advent, to intlame their desires and confirm
their expectatione, that they might not be discouraged by so
