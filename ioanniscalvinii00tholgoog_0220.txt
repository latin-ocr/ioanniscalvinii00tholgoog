them in possession of their opinion, 1 shall follow what appears
to me to be preferable; that is, that what they make the first
precept is aprefaee to the whole law3 that it· is followedby
the precepts, four belonging to the first table and six to the
second, in the order in which they will now be recited. Origen
has mentioned this division as if it were universally received in
his time without any controversy. Augustine also coincides
with us3 for in enumerating thern to Boniface, he observes
this order: That God alone be religiously worshipped ; that no
odoratior] be pald to an idol, that the name of the Lord ba not
taken in vain. He had before spoken separately os the sha-
dowy precept of the sabbath. It is true, that in another passage
he expresses his approbatiou of the former division, but. for a
most trivial reason ; namely, that if the first table be digested
into three precepts, the trinal number will be a more conspi-
cuous exhibition of the mystery of the Trinity. ln the same
place, however, he does not conceal that in other respects he
prefers our division. Beside these writers the author of the
unfinished treatise on Matthew is of the same opinion with us.
Josephus, doubtless according to the common opinion of his 0
time, assigns five precepts to each table. This is repugnant to
reason, because it confounds the distinction between religion
and charity3 and is also refntcd by the authority of our Lord,
who in Matthew places the precept concerning honour to pa·
rents in the second table. Now let us hear God himself speak-
ing iu his own words.

XIII. Whether you make the first sentence a part of the
first commandment, or read it separately, is a matter of indif-
ference to me, provided you allow it to be a preface to the
whole law. The first object of attention in making laws is to
guard against their being abrogated by contempt. Therefore
God in the first place provides, that the majesty of the law,
which he is about to deliver, may never fall into contempt3
and to sanction it he uses a threefold argument. He asserta
his authority and right of giving commanda, and thereby lays
his chosen people undere necessity tof obeying them. He
exhibits a promise of grace, to allure them byits tscharms to
the pursuit of hollness. He reminds the Israelites of his fa·
vour, to convict them of ingratitude if they do not conduct
themselves rn amanner correspondent to his goodness. The
