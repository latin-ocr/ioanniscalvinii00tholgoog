but, aroused with fear, to leam humility. For, since man is
subject toa world of miserias, and has been spoiled of his
divine erray, this melancholy exposure discovers an immense
mass of deformity: every one, therefore, must be so impressed
witha consciousness of his own infelicity, as to arrive at some
knowledge of God. Thus a sense of our ignorance, vanity,
poverty, infinnity, depravity, and corruption, leads us to per-
ceive and aeknowledge that in the Lord alone are to be found
true wisdom, solid strength, perfect goodness, and nnspotted
righteousness; and so, by our imperfectione, we are excited to
aconsideration of the perfectione of God. Nor can we really
aspire toward him, till we have begun to be displeased with
ourselves. For who would not gladly rest satisfied with him-
self? where is the man not actually absorbed in sels-compla-
cency, while he remains unacquainted with his true situation,
or content with his own endowments, and ignorantur forgetful
of his own misery? The knowledge of ourselves, therefore,
is not only an incitament to seek after God, but likewise a con·
siderable assistance towards finding him.

ll. On the other hand, it is plain that no man can arrive at
the true knowledge of himself, without having first contem·
plated the divine character, and then descended to the consid·
eration of his own. For, such is the native pride of us all, we}
invariably esteem ourselves righteous, innocent, wise, and holy,l
till we are convinced, by clear proofs, of our unrighteousness,
turpitude, folly, and impurity. But we are never thus con-
vinced, while we confine our attention to ourselves, and regard
not the Lord, who is the only standard by which this judgment
ought to be formed. Because, from our natural proneness to
hypocrisy, any vain appearance os righteousness abundantly
contents us instead of the reality; arrd, every thing within
and around us being exceedingly defiled, we are delighted
with what is least so, as extremely pure, while we confine our
reflections within the limits of human corruption. So the
eye, accustomed to see nothing but black, jndges that to be
very white, which is but whitish, or perhaps browu. lndeed,
the senses of our bodies may assist us in discovering how
grossly we err in estimating the powers of the soul. For if at
noonday we loolt citheron the ground, or at any surrounding
objects, we conclude our vision to be very strong and piercing,
but when we raise our eyes and steadily look at the sun, they
are at once dazzled and confounded with such a blaze of
brightness, and we are constrained to confess, that our sight,
so piercing in viewing terrestrial things, when directed to the
sun, is dimness itself. Thus also it happens in the considera·
tion of our spiritual cndowments. For as long as our views
arc bounded by the earth, perfectly content with our own
