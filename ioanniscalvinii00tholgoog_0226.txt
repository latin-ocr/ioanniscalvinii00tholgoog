is, that we do not prostitute our souls to Satan, to lust, and to
the impurity of the carnal appetites. Wherefore, when he
reproves the apostasy of the Jews, he complains that they
had discarded chastity, and were polluted with adulteries. (y)
Therefore, as a husband, in proportion to the superiority of his
purity and chastity, is the more grievously incensed, if he per·
ceive the affection of his wife inclining to a rival, so the Lord,
who has in truth espousedus to himself, declares that he feels
the most ardent jealousy, whenever we neglect the sacred purity
of his conjugal relation to us, and defile ourselves with cri·
minal lusts, but especially when we transfer to any other, or
adulterate with any superstition, the worship of his majesty,
which ought to be preserved in the most consummate· persec-
tion; since by such conduct we not only violate the saith
pledged in our nuptials, but even pollute our souls with spirit·

XIX. Let us inquire what he intends by his threatening to
“visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third
and fourth generation.” For besides that it is inconsistent with
the equity of the Divina justice to inflict upon an innocent per-
son the punishment due to the offences of another, God ln'mself
declares that “the son shall not bear the iniquity of the fa·
ther.'’ (z) But this expression is repeated more than once, con·
ceming adeserring to future generations of the punishments of
crimes committed by their ancestors. For Moses frequently
speaks of “the Lord visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon
the children unto the third and fourth generation.” (a)
lu like manner Jeremiah: “Thou showest leving-kindness
unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers
into the bosom of their children after them.’' (b) Some, who
labour very hard to solve this difficulty, are of opinion that
its meaning is to be confined to temporal punishments;
which if children sustain through the sins of their parents,
there is nothing absurd in it; because they frequently con·
duce to the salvation of those on whom they are inflicted.
This is certainly true. For Isaiah denounced to Hezekiah,
that on account of the sin which he had committed, his sons
should be despoiled of the kingdom and carried away into
exile. (c) The families of Pharaoh and Abimelech are afflicted
on account of the injury sustained by Abraham. (d) But when
tlris is adduced as a solution of these questions, it is rather an
evasion of it, than a proper explanation. For in this and in
similar places the Lord threatens a punishment too great to be
terminated by the limits of the present life. lt must therefore
