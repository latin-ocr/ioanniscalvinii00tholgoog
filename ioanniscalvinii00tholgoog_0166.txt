by tha pretext of having been incapsble of acting otherwise,
heis prepared with an auswer, which we have elsewhere ad·
vanced, that it arises not from creation, but from the corruption
of nature, that rnen, being enslaved by sin, can will nothing but
whatis evil. For whence proceeded that impotence, of which
the ungodlywould gladly avail themselves, but from Adam
voluntarily devoting himself to the tyranny of the davil?
Hence, therefore, the corruption -with which we are firmly
bound. 1t originated in the revolt of the first man from his
Maker. If all meu are justly accounted guilty of this rebellion,
let them not suppose themselves excused by necessity, in which
very thing they have a most evident cause of their condemnation.
And this 1 bave before clearly explained, and have given an
example in the devil himself, which shows, that he who sins
necessarily, sins no less voluntarily3 and also in the elect an·
gels, whose will, though it cannot swerve from what is good,
ceases not to be a will. Bemard also judiciously inculcatas
the same doctrine, that we are, therefore, the more miserable
because our necessity is voluntaryJ which yet constrains us to
be so devoted to it, that we are, as we have already observed,
the slaves of sin. The second branchos their argument is
erroneous3 because it makes an improper transition from what
is voluntary to what rs free, but we have before evinced, that
a thing may be done voluntarily, which yet is not the subject
of free choica.

from the free choice of the will, it is not reasonable either that
punishments should be inflictcd‚ or that rewards should be
conferred on man. This argument, though first advanced by
Aristotle, yet l grant is used on some occasions by chrysostom
and Jerome. 'Phat it was familiar to the Pelagians, however,
Jerome himself does not dissembla, but even relatas their own
words: “lf the grace of God operatas in us, then the crown
will be given to grace, not to us who labour.’' ln regard to
punishments, 1 reply that they are justly inflicted on uS, from
whom the guilt of srn proceeds For of what importance is it,
whether siu be committed with a judgment free or euslaved‚
so it be committed with the voluntary bias of the passione,
especially as man is proved to be a sinuer, because he is sub,-
J'ect to the servitude of sin? With respect to rewards of
righteousness, where is the great absurdity, if we confess that
they depend rather on the Divine benignity than on our own
merits? How often does this recur in Angustiae, “ that God
crowns not our maritabat his own gifts; and that they are
called rewards, not as though they were due to our merite, but
because they are retributions to the graces already conferred ou
us l '’ They discover great acuteuess, in this observation, that
