men, what should be handed down by tradition to their pos·
terity, it is beyond a doubt that their minds were impressed
with a firm assurance of the doctrine, so that they were per·
suaded and convinced that the information they had received
came from God. For God always secured to his word an un·
doubted credit, superior to all human opinion. At length, that
the truth might remain in the world in a continual course of
instruction to all ages, he determined that the same eracles
which he had deposited with the patriarcha should be commit·
ted to public records. With this design the Low was promul·
gated, to which the Prophcts were afterwards annexed, as its
interpretem. -For, though the uses of the law were many, as
will be better seen in the proper place, and particularly the
intention of Moses, and of all the prophete, was to teach tho
mode of reconciliation between God and man, (whence also
Paul calls Christ “the end of the law,”) (i)-yetI repeat
again, that, beside the peculiar doctrine of faithand repentance,
which proposes Christ as the Mediator, the Scripture distin·
guishes the only true God by certain characters and titles, as
the Creator and Governor of the world, that he may not be
confounded with the multitude of false gods. Therefora,
though every man should seriously apply himself to a consid·

theatre to be a spectator of them, yet he ought principally to
attend to the word, that he may attain superior advantages.
And, therefore, it is not surprising, that they who are born in
darkness grow more and more hardened in their stupidity3
since very few attend to the word of God with teachable dis·
positione, to restrain themselves within the limits which it
prescribes, but rather exult in their own vanity. This, then,
must be considered as a fiaed principle, that, in order to enjoy
the light of true religion, we ought to begin with the doctrine
of heaven 3 and that no man can have the least knowledge of
true and sound doctrine, without having been a disciple of the
Scripture. Hence originales all true wisdom, when we em·
brace with revereuce the testimony which God hath been
pleased therein to deliver concerning himself. For obedience
is the source, not only of an absolutely perfect arrd complete
saith, but of all right knowledge of God. And tmly in this
instance God heth, iu his providence, particularly consulted
the true interests of mankind in all ages.

lll. For, if weconsider the mutability of the human mind, -
how easy its lapse into forgetfulness of God3 how great its pro-
pensity to errors of every kind3 how violent its roge for the
perpetual fabrication of new and false religious, -it will bo easy
