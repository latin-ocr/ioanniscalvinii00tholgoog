the righteous judgment of God, not for the sins of others, but
on account of their own iniquity.

XXI. On the other hand, God gives a promise to extend his
mercy to a thousand generations3 which also frequently occurs
in the Scriptura, and is inserted in the solemn covenant with
the Ohurch: “I will be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after
thee.'’(f) In allusion to this, Solomon says, that “the chil-
dren of the just man are blessed after him ; ’' f g) not only as the
effect of arcligious education, which is of no small importance,
bnt also in consequence of the blessing promised in the covenant,
that the grace of God shall perpetually remain in the familias of
the pious. This is a source of peculiar consolation to the faith-
ful, but to the impious of great terror ; for if, even aster death, the
memory ofrighteousness and iniquity has so much influenee with
God, that the curse of the one and the blessing of the other will
redound to posterity, much more will it remain on the persons
of the actors themselves. Now, it is no objection to our argu·
ment, that the descendants of the impious sometimes grow bct-
ter, while those of the faithful degenerate; since the legislator
never intended to establish in this case such an invariable rute,
as would derogato from his own free ohoice. For it is suffi-
cient for the consolation of the righteous and the terror of the
sinaei, that the denunciation is not vain or inefficacious, al·
though it be not always executed. For as the temporal pu·
nishments inflicted on a few wicked men are testimonias of the
Divine wrath against sin, and of the judgment that will here·
after be pronounced on all sinuers, though many escape with
impunity even to the end of their liveS, so, when the Lord ex·
hibits one example of this blessing, in manifesting his mercy
and goodness to the son for the sake of his father, he affords a
proof of his constant and perpetual favour to his worshippers;
and when„in any one instance, he pursues the iniquity of the
father in the son, he shows what a judgment awaits all the
reprobate on account of their own transgressions3 the certainty
of which was what he principally designed in this passage. He
also gives us a cursory intimation of the greatness of his mercy,
which he extends to a thousand generations, while he has aa·
signed only four generations to his vengeance.

XXII. The end of this precept is, that the Lord will have
thc majesty of his name to be held inviolably sacred by us.
