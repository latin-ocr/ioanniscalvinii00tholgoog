figure of some spiritual mystery, but only use 1t as a remedy
necessary to the preservation of order in the‚Church. But they
say, Paul teaches that Christians are not to be judged in the
observance of it, because it is ashadow of something fu·
ture. (o) Therefore he is “ afraid lest ’' he has “bestowed ’¹ on
the Galatians ¹‘ labour in vaiu,’' because they continued to “ ob·
serve days.’' (w) And in the Epistle to the Romans, he as·
serts him to be ‘⁶ weak in the faith,'’ who “ estoemeth one day
above another.” (c) But who, these furious zealots only ex·
cepted, does not see what observance the apostle intends? For
they did not observe them for the sake of politica] and ecclesi-
astical order 3 but when they retained them as shadows of spi-
ritual things, they were so far guilty of obscuring the glory of
, Christ and the light of tho gospel. They did not, therefore, rest
from their manual labours, as from employments which would
divert them from sacred studies and meditations; but from a
principle of superstition, imagining their cessation from labour
to be still an expression of reverence for the mysteries formerly
'represented by it. This preposterous distinctiones days the
Apostle strenuously opposes; and not that legitimare difference
which promotes the peace of the Christian Ohurch. For in the
churches which he founded, the sabbath was retained for this

lf superstition be an object of fear, there was more danger in
the holy days of the Jews, than in the Lord’s days now observed
by Christians. Now, whereas it was expedient for the destruc·
tion of superstition, the day which the Jews kept holy was abo-
lished3 and it being necessary for the preservation of decorum,
order, and peace, in the Christian Church, another day was ap-
pointed for the same use.

XXXIV. Howevcr, the ancients have not without sufficient
reason substituted what we call the Lord’s day in the room of
the sabbath. For since the resurrectiones the Lord is the end
and consummation of that true rest, which was adumbrated by
the ancient sabbath, the same day which putari end to the
shadows, admonishes Christiarrs not to adhere to a shadowy
ceremony. Yet l do not lay so much stress on the septenary
number, that Ι would obligo the Church to an invariable ad-
herencc to it3 nor will l condemn those churches which have
other solemn days for their assemblies, provided they hcep at a .
distance from superstition. And this will be the case, if they
be only designed for the observance of discipline and well-regu·
lated order. Let us sum up the whole in the following mau-
ner: As the truth was delivered to the Jews under a figure, so
