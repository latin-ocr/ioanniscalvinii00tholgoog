of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: tne statutas of the
Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the

and many others, which he introduces in every part of this
psalm. Nor are these assertione repugnant to those of Paul, in
which he shows, not what service the law renders to the re·
generate, but what it can bcstow upon man merely of itsels ;
whereas the Psalmist in these passages celebrates the great
advantage derived, through the Divina teaching, from the read·
ing of the law, by those whom God inspires withan inward
promptitude to obediancc. And hc adverts not only to the
precepts, but to the promise of grace annexed to their perform·
ance, which alone causes that which is bitter to become sweet.
For what would be less amiable than the law, if by demands
and threats it only distressed the mind with fear, and harassed
it with terror? But David particularly shows, that in the law
he discovered the Mediator, without whom there is nothing
pleasant or delightful.

XIII. Some unskilful men, being unable to discam this
distinction, rashly explode Moses altogether, and discard the
two tables of the law3 because they consider it improper for
Christians to adhere to a doctrine which contains the adminis-
tration of death. Far from us be this profana opinion3 for
Moses has abundantly taught us, that the law, which in sin-
ners can only produce death, ought to have a better and more
excellent use in the saints. For just before his death hc thus
addressed tha people: “Set your hearts unto all the words
which l testify among you this day, which ye shall command
your children to observe, to do all the words of this law. For
it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life.’' (r)
But if no one can deny that the law exhibits a perfect model
of righteousness, either we ought to have no rule for an up·
{ight pud just life, or it is primipallifforbns to devira'th from it.

represents the life of a righteous man as spent in continual
meditations on the law, (s) we must not refer it to one period
of time only, because it is very suitable for all agea, even to
the end cf the world. Let us neither bc deterred, therefore,
nor fly from its instructions, because it prescribes a holiness far
more complete than we shall attain, as long as we remain in
the prison of the body. For it no longer exercises towards us
the part of a‘rigorous exactor, only to be satisfied by the per·
fect performance of every injunction; but in this perfectiori,
