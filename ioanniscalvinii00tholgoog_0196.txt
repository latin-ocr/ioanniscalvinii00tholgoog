divinely chosen with an oath, to be “a priest fer ever after
the order of Melchisedec.’' (s) There was, then, an unction
of visible oil; but Daniel, from his vision, loretello an unctien
efa different lrind. But not to insist on many procis, the
author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, from the fourth chapter
to the eleventh, demonstrates in a manner sufficiently copious
and clear, that, irrespective of Christ, all the ceremonias of the
law are worthless and vain. And in regard to the decalogue,
we should attend to the declaration of Paul, that “Christ is
the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believ-
eth ; ’³ (t) and also that Christ is “the Spirit,'’ who gives “ life '’
to the otherwise dead letter. (a) For in the former passage he
signifies that righteousness is taught in vain by the precepts,
· till Christ bestows it both by a gratuitous imputation, and by
the Spirit of regeneratien. Wherefore he justly denominatas
Christ the completion or end of the law; for we should derive
no benefit from a knowledge of what God requires of us, un·
less we were succoured by Christ when labonring and op·
pressed under its yoke and intolerable burden. In another
place, he states that “the law was added because of transgres-
sions ; ” (w) that is, to humble men, by convicting them of being
the causes of their own condemnation. Now, this being the
true and only preparation for eceking Christ, the various dc·
clarations which he rnalrcs are in perfect unison with each
other. But 'as he was then engaged in a controversy with
erroneous teachers, who pretended that we merit righteousness
by the works of the law, -in order to refuta their error, he was
sometimes obliged to use the term law in a more restricted
sense, as merely preceptive, although it was otherwise con·
nectcd with the covenant of gratuitous adoption.

Ill. But it is worthy of a little inquiry, how we are ren·
dered more· inexcusable by the instructions of the moral law,
in order that a sense of our guilt may excite us to supplicate
for pardon. lf it be true that the law displays a perfectiori
· of righteousness, it also follows that the complete observation
of it, is in the sight of God a perfect righteousness, in which a
man would be esteemed and reputed righteous at the tribunal
of heaven. Wherefore Moses, when he had promulgated the
law, hesitated net to “eall heaven and earth to r'ecord’' (a)
that he had proposed to the Israelites life and death, good and
evil. Nor can we deny that the reward of eternal life awaits
a righteous obedience to the law, according to the Divine pro·
mise. But, on the other hand, it is proper to examine whether
we perform that obedieuce, the merit of which can warrant
