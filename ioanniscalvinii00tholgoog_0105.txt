every where occurs, reduces to nothing whatever notione of
the Deity men may sorni in their own imaginations; since
God alone is asufficient witness concaming himself. ln
the mean time, since the whole world has been seized with
such brutal stupidity, as to be desirous oi visible representa·
tione os the Deity, and thus to fabricate gods of wood, stone,
gold, silver, and other inanimate and corruptible materiale, we
ought to hold this as a certain principle, that, whenever any
image is mede as a representation of God, the Divine glory
is corrupted by an impious falsehood. Therefore God, in the
law, aster having asserted the glory of Deity to belong ex·
clusively to himself, when he intends to show what worship
he approves or rejects, immediately adds, ‘⁶ Thou shalt not
make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness.’' ln these
words he sorbids us ιο attempt a representation oi himin any
visible figure3 and briedy enumeratas all the forms by which
superstition had already begun to change his tmth into a lie.
For the Persians, we knotv, worshipped the sun; and the sool·
ish heatben made ior themselves as many gods as they saw
stars in the heavens. There was scarcely an animal, indeed,
which the Egyptians did not consider as an image os God.
The Greeks appeared wiser than the rest, because they wor-
shipped the Deity under the human form. (d) But God com·
pares not idols with each other, as though one were better or
worse than another; but rejects, without a single exception,
all statues, picturas, and other figures, in which idolaters
imagined that he would be near them.

11. This it is easy to infer srorn the reasons which he an-
nexes to the prohibition. First, in the writings of Moses:
“ ‘Pake ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; sor ye saw no
manner of similitude, ou the day that the Lord spake unte you
in Horeb, οιιι oi the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice os
the words, but saw no similitude; lest ye corrupt yourselves,
and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figrue,’'
tre. (e) We see howexpressly God opposes his ‘⁴ voice '' ιο every
“ manner of similitude,” ιο show, that whoever desircs visible
representatione os him, is guilty of departing from him. 1ι will
be sufficient ιο refer to one of the Propheta, Isaiah, (s ) who iu·
sists more than all the others on this argument, that the Divine
Majesty is dishonoured by mean and absurd fiction, when he
that is incorporenl is likened ιο acorporeal sorm; he that is
invisible, to a visible image; he that is a spirit, to inanimale
matter3 and he that fills immensity, ιο alog os wood, a small
stone, or a lump os gold. Paul nlso reasons in the same man·
