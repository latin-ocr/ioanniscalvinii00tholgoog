creatos light and darkness, that he forms good and evil, (d)
and that no evil occurs, which he bas not performed. Let
them say, then, whether he exereises his judgments voluntarily
or involuntarily. Butes Moses suggests, that he who is killed
by the fortuitous fall of an axe, is delivered by God to the
stroke, (e) so iu the Acts, the whole church asserta that Herod
and Pilato conspired todo what the hand and the counsel of
God had predetermined. (s) And indeed, unless the cruci-
fixion of Christ was according to the will of God, what be·
comes of our redemptiou? Yet the will of God is neither
repugnant to itself, nor subject to change, nor chargeable with
pretending to dislilre what it approves3 but whilst in him it is
uniform and simple, it wears to us the appearance of variety;
because the weakness of our understanding comprehende not
how the same thing may be in different respects both agree-
able to his will, and contrary to it. Paul, after having said
that the vocetion of the Gentiles was a hidden mystery, adds,
that it contained a manifestation of the manifold wisdom of
God. (g) Now, because, through the dulness of our capacity,
the Divine wisdom appears to us manifold, (or multiform, as it
hasbeen translated by an ancient interpreter,) shall we there·
fore dream of any vanity in God himself, as though his coun-
sels were mutable, or his thoughts contradictory to each other?
Rather, while we comprehend not how God intends that to be
done, the doing of which he forbids, let us remember our
imbecility, and at the same time consider, that the light which
he inhabits, is justly called inaccessible, (Ιι) because it is over·
spread with impenetrablc darkness. 'l'heresore all pious and
modest men will easily acquiesce in this opinion of Augustius:
“That a man may sometimes choose, with a good intention,
that which is not agreeable to the will of God; as, if a good
son wishes his father to live, whilst God determines that he
shall die. lt is also possible sor a man to will witha bad
design, what God wills with a good one3 as, ifa bad son
wishes his father to die, which is also the will of God. Now,
the former wishes what is not agreeable, the latter what is
agreeable to the Divine will. And yet the filial affection of
the former is more consonant to the righteous will of God,
than the want of natural affection in the latter, though it ao· ,
cords with his secret design. So great is the differenee
between what belongs to the human will, and what to the
Divina, and between the ends to which the will of every one
is to be referred, for approbation or censure. For God fulfils
his righteous will by the wicked wills of wicked men.” This
writer had just before said, that the apostate angels, and all
