did not reign by the will of God, and yet that God ap·
pointed him to be king? Why, thus: because neither could '
the people revolt from the family of David, without shaking
ofl' the yoke which God had imposed upon them; nor yet was
God deprived of the liberty of thus punishing the ingratitude
of Solomon. We see, then, how God, while he hates perfidy,
yet righteously and with a different design decrees the de·
fection; whence also Jeroboam is, beyond all expectation,
constrained by the holy unctiori to assume the regal office.
ln the same manner, the Saered History relates, that God
raised up an enemy, to deprive theson of Solomon of part of
the kingdom. (p) Let the reader diligently consider both
these things: because it had pleased God that the people
should be under the government of one king, their division
into two parts was contrary to his will; and yet from his will
the schism first originated. For certainly since a Prophet,
both by a prediction and by the ceremony of unction, excited
a hope of succeeding to the kingdom, in the mind of Jero·
boam, who before entertained not a thought of such an event,
this could not be dorae, either without the knowledge, or
against the will, of God, who commanded it to be done; and
yet the rebellion of the people is justly condemned, because,
in opposition to the Divina will, they revolted fronr the pos·
terity of David. Thus, also, it is afterwards subjoined, that
“ the cause '' of the haughty contempt of the people manifested
by Rehoboam “was of God, that the Lord might perform his
word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah ’² his servant. (q)
See how the sacred union is divided, in opposition to the will
of God, and yet by his will the ten tribes are alienated from
the son os Salomon. Let us add another similar example,
where, with the consent, and even by the assistance of the
- people, the sons of Ahab are massacred, and all his posterity
exterminated. (r) John, indeed, truly observed that “there
had fallen unte the earth nothing of the werd of the Lord,’'
but that he had “done that which he spake by his servant
Elijah.’' And yet he justly repreheuds the citizens of Samaria
for having lent their assistance. “Are ye righteous? ” says
he; “ behold, l conspired against my master, and slew him,
but who slew all these? '' lf l um not deceived, 1 have now
clearly explained how the same act displays the criminality os
men aud the justice of God. And to modest minds this an·
swer of Augustius will always be sufficient: “Since God de-
livered Christ, and Christ delivered his own body, and Judas
delivered the Lerd, why, in this delivery, is God righteous and
man guilty? Because in the same act, they acted not from
