are so frivolous aud ridiculous, or rain and falsa. Nor, ii they
were ever so pretematural, ought they to have any weight in
opposition to the truth oi God, since the name oi God ought

to be sanctified in all places and at all times, whether by mirac·
ulons events, or by the common order ot* nature. This sallacy
might perhaps be more specium, if the Scriptura did not apprire
ns oi the legitimate end and use oi miracles. For hiark informs
us, that the miracles which followed the prcaching of the apos·
tles were wrought in confirmation (le) oi it, and Luhe tells ur,
that(l) “the Lord gave testimony to the word os his graoe,”
when ‘⁴ signs and wonders '’ were “done by the hands '’ of the
apostles Very similar to which is the assertiones the apostle,
that “salvation was confirmed ’' by the preaching of the Goe-
pel, “ God also bearing witness with signs, and wonders‚ aud
divers miracles.”(m) But those things which we are told
were seals os the Gospel, shall we pervert to undennine the
saith os the Gospel? Those things which were designed to be
testimonials os the truth, shall we accommodate to the con·
firmation os salechood? It isright, therefore, that the doctrine,
which, according to the evangelist, claims the first attention,
bo examined and tried in the first place, and if it be approved,
thenit ought toderire confirmation from miracles. But it is
the characteristic of sound doctrine, giren by Christ, that it
tends to promote, not the glory os men, but the glory of God. (n)
Christ having laid down this proci of a doctrine, it is wrong to
esteem those as miracles which are directed to any other end
, than the glorification oi the name of God alone. And we
should remember that Satan has his wonders, which, though
they are juggling tricks rather than real miracles, are such as
to delude the ignorant and inexperieuced. Magicians and en·
chanters have always been famous for miracles3 idolatry has
been supported by astonishing miracles; aud yet we admit thern
not as proofs of the superstition of magicians or idolaters. With
this eugine also the simplicity of the vulgar was anciently as·
sailed by the Donatista, who aboundcd in miracles. We there·
fore gire the carne answer now to our adversaries as Augus·
tine (o) gave to the Donatista, that our Lord hath cautioned us
against these miraclemongers by his prediction, that there
