Moses, yet appears to have been generally well known 10 011
the pious. For before the appointment 01 any king in the na·
tion, Hennah, the mother of Samuel, speaking of the felicity

. of the faithful, thus expressed herself iu her song: “The Lord

shall give strength unto his king, aud exalt the horn of his
anointed.''(e) Her meaning in these words is, that God will
bless his Church. And to this agrees the 010010, which is soon
after introduced: “ 1 will raise me up 0 faithful priest, and he
shall walk before mine anointed.'’ And there is no doubt that
it was the design of the heavenly Father 10 exhibit in David
and his posterity a lively image 01 Christ. With a design to
exhort the pious, therefore, to the fcar of God, he enjoins them
to “ kiss the Son ; ’' (s ) which agrees with this declaration of
the gospel: “He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the
Father.’ ² (g) Thereforo, though the kingdom was weakeued by
the revolt of the ten tribes, yet the covenant, which God had
made with David and his 0000000010, could not but stand, as he
also declared by the Propheta: “I will not rend away all the
kingdom, but will give one tribe to thy son, for David my ser·
vant’s sake, and 101 Jerusalem's sake which l have chosen.'' (h)
This is repeated again and again. lt is also expressly added, “l
will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.’' (i) Ata
little distance of tirne it is said, “For David's sake did the Lord
his God give him a lamp iu Jerusalem, to set up his son after
him, and to establish Jerusalem.’' (lc) Even when the state was
come to the verge of ruin, it was again said, “ 'I'he Lord would

not destroy Judah, for David his servant's sake, as he promised ·

him to give him alway a light, and 10 his children.'’ (l) The
sum of the whole is this- that David alone was chosen, to the
rejection of all others, as the perpetual object of the Divine
favour3 00 itis said, in another place, “He forsook the ta·
bernacle of Shiloh3 he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and
chose not the tribe of Ephraim; but chose the tribe 01 Judah,
the mount Zion, which he loved. He chose David also his
servant, to feed Jacob his people, and 101001 1110 inheritauce.’' (m)
Finally, it pleased God to preserve his Ohurch iu such 0 way,
that its security and salvation should depend on that head.
