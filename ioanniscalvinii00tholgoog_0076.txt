they persuade themselves, is of little importance; since the
Holy Spirit pronounces all to be apostates, who, in the dark-
ness of their minda, substitute demons in the place of God.
For this reason Paul declares the Ephesiates to have besu
“without God ” (a)-till they had learned from the gospcl
the worship of the true God Nor should thisbe restricted to
one nation only, since, in another place, he asserts of meu in
general, that they “became vain in their imaginations,” (y)
after the majesty of the Creator had been discovered to thern
in the structure of the world. And therefore the Scripture,
to make roorn for the only true God, condemns, es false and
lying, whatever was formerly worshipped as divine among the
Gentiles, (z) and leaves no Deity bnt in Mount Sion, where
flourished the peculiar knowledge of God. Iudeed, among

the Gentiles, the Samaritaus, iu the days of Christ, seemed to ‘

approach very nearly to true piety; yet we hear, from the
mouth of Christ, that they “worshipped they knew not
what ; ”(o) whence it follows, that they were under a vain
and erroneous delusion. In hue, though they were not all the
subjecta of gross vices, or open idolaters, there was no pure
and approved religion, their notions being founded only in
common sense. F'or, though there were a few uniufected with
the maduess of the vulgar, this assertion of Paul remains uu·
shaken, that “ none of the princes of this world knew the wis-
dom of God.'’ (b) But if the most exalted have been involved
in the darkness of error, what must he said of the dregs of the
people! Wherefore it is not surprising if the Holy Spirit ra·
ject, as spurious, every form of worship which is of human con·
trivance; because, iu the mysteries of heaven, an opinion ac·
quired by human means, though it may not always produce
nn immense mass of errors, yet always produces some. And
though no worse consequence follow, it is no trivial fault to
worship, at an uncertainty, an unknown god, of which, how-
ever, Christ pronounces all to be guilty who have not been
taught by thc law what god they ought to worship. And
indeed the hest legislatore have proceedcd no further than to
declare religion to be founded upon common consent. And
even Socrates, in Xenophon, (c) praiscs the answcr of Apollo,
which directed that every man should worship the gods ac-
cording to the rites of his country, and the custom of his own
city. But whence had mortals this right of determining, by
their own authority, what far exceeds all the world? or who
could so acquiesce in the decrees of the rulers or the ordinances
of the people, as without hesitation to receive a god delivered
