IV. It was tne will of God that the Jews should be in·
structed by these prophecies, so that they might direct their
eyes to Christ whenever they wanted deliverence. Nor, in·
deed, notwithstanding their shameful degeneracy, could the
memory ol this general principle ever be obliterated—that
God would be the deliverer of the Chnrch by the hand of
Christ, according to his promise to David3 and that in this
manner the covenant of grace, in which God had adopted
his elect, would at length be confirmed. Hence it came to
pass, that when Christ, a little before his death, entered into
Jerusalem, that song was heard from the mouths of children,
“ Hosanna to the Son os David.’' ( s ) For the subject of their

os the Redeemer. For this reason Christ commands his dis·
ciples to believe in him, that they may distinctly and persectly
believe in God: ‘⁶ Ye believe in God, believe also in me.'’ (g)
For though, strictly speaking, saith ascends stom Christ to the
Father, yet he suggests, that though it were even fixed on
God, yet it would gradually decline, unless he interposed, to
preserve its stability. The majesty of God is otherwise sar

the earth. Wherefore, though 1 do not reject that common
observation that God is the objectos saith, yet Ι consider itas

this appellation we are reminded, that unless God reveal him·
sels to us in Christ, we cannot have that knowledge of him
which is necessary to salvation. For although among the
Jews tlre scribes had by false glosscs obscured the declaratione
of the Prophets concerning the Redeemer, yet Christ assumed
it for granted, as if allowed by common consent, that there
was no other remedy for the confusion into which the Jews
had fallen, nor any other mode of deliverance for the Choreb,
but the exhibitiones the Mediator. There was not, indeed,
such a general knowledge as thereought to have been, of the
principle taught by Paul, that “Christ is the end of the
law; ’⁵ (i) but the truth and certainty of this evidently appears ,
both from the law itself and from tho Propheta. Iam not yet
