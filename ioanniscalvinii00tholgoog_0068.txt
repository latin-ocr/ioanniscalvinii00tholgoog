their different offices with as much diligeuce as is eo many
souls by common consent govemed one body?

V. But my present concern is not with that sty os swines:
lrather addresr those who, influenced by preposterous subtil·
ties, would indirectly employ that srigid dogma of Aristode to
destroy the immortality oi the soul, and deprive God of his
rights. For, because the orgaus oi the body are directed by
the laculties ol the soul, they pretend the soul to be so united
to the body as to be incapable os subsisting without it; and by
their eulogies os nature do all they can to suppress tlre name
· of God. But the powers of the soul are sar from being limited
to iunctions subservierit to thc body. Por what concern has
the body in measuring the heavens, counting the number os
the stara, computing their several magnitudes, and aequiring a
knowledge of their respective distances, ol the celerity or tar·
diness of their courses, and os the degrees of their various dec·
linationsl 1 grant, indeed, the usefulness os astronomy, but
only remark that, iu these prosound researches relating to the
celestial orbs, there is no corporeal coiiperation, but that the
aoul has ita iunctione distinct from the body. 1 have proposed
oue example, whence insersnces may readily be drawn by the
readers The manisold agility ol' the soul, which enables it to
take a survey os heaven and earth; to join the past and the
present3 to retain the memory of things heard long ag03 to
conceive os whatever it chooses by the help oi imagination;
its ingenuity also in the invention os such admirable arts, -are
certain proofs os the divinity in man. Besides, in sleep, it not
only turns and moves itself round, but conceives many usesul
ideas, reasons on various subjecta, and even divines future
events. What shall we say, but that the vestiges oi immortal-
ity impressed upon man are absolutely indelible? Now, what
reason can be given, why man, who isos divine original, should
not acknowledge his Creator? Shall we indeed, by the judg-
ment with which we are endued, discern right from wrong,
and shall there be no judge in heaven? Shall we, eveu in our
sleep, have some remains os intelligence, and shall there be no
God to govern the world? Shall we be esteemed thc invent·
ers ol‘ so many useful arte, that God may be defrauded os his
praise? Whereas experience abundantly teaches, that all we
have is variously distributed to us by some superior Being.
The clamour ol some, about a secret inspiration auimating tho
whole world, is not only weak, but altogether profane. They
are pleased with the celebrated passage of Virgil -

“ linow, lirst, r spirit, with au active dame,
hihi hiidghnhssnhiieii ihihiiigirig iiidie.

The ponderans earth, the depths of heaven ; and there
Glows in the run rad moon, aad buras iu every star.
