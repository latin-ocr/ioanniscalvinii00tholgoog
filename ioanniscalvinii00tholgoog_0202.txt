have of yonrself no ability to work righteousness, that thus,
being poor, indigent, and destitute, you might have recourse
to grace for relief.'’ Afterwards he addresses himself to God:
“Thus do, O Lordl thus do, O mercifrd Lord! command that
which cannot be performed: even command that which cannot
be performed without thy grace: that when men cannot per·
form it iu their own strength, every mouth may be stopped,
and no man appear great in his own estimation. Let all men
be mean, and let all the world be proved guilty before God.’'
But I arn not wise in collecting so many testimonies, when this
holy man has written a treatise expressly on this subject, which
he has entitled De Spiritu et ln'tero, On the Spirit and Letter.
'I'he second use of the law he does not so clearly describe,
either because he knew that it depends on the first, or because
he did not so fully tmderstand it, or because he wanted words
to explain it with distinctness and perspicuity adequate to his
ideas of it. Yet this first officeof the law is not confined to
the pious, but extends also to the reprobate. For though they
do not, with the children of God, advance so far as, after the
mortification of the flesh, to be renewed, arrd to flourish again
in the inner man, but, confounded with the first horrors of con·
science, remain in despair, yet they contributa to manifest the
equity of the Divine judgment‚ by their consciences being
agitated with such violent emotions. For they are always
desirous of cavilling against the judgment of God3 but now,
while it is not yet manifested‚ they are, nevertheless, so con·
founded with the testimony of the law and of their own con·
science, that they betray in themselves what they have deservedr

X. The second office of the law is, to cause those who,
unless constrained, feel no concern for justice and rectitudo,
when thcy hear its terrible sanctione, to be at least restrained
by a fear of its penalties. And they are restrained, not because
it internally influences or affects their minds, but because, be-
ing chained, as it were, they refrain from external acts, and
repress their depravity within them, which otherwise they
would have wantonly discharged. This makes them neither
better nor more righteous in the Divine view. For although,
being prevented either by fear or by shame, they dare not exe·

cute what their minds have contrived, nor openly discover the ·

fury of their passione, yet their hearts are not disposed to fear
and obey God, and the more they restrain themselves, the
more violently they are infiamed within; they ferment, they
boil, ready to break out into any external acts, if they were
not prevented by this dread of the law. And not only so, they
also inveterately hate the law itself, and execrate God the law·
giver, so that, if they could, they would wish to annihilata him
whom they cannot bear, either in commanding that which is
