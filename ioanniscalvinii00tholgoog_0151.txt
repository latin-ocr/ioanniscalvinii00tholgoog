that the selection, which shall be made, preparas away to the
understanding of all the rest, which are frequently to be found.
Nor do Ι think that there will be any impropriety in evincing
my agreement with that man, to whose authority the consent
of the picus pays a great and merited deference. 'Phe origin of
all good clearly appears, from a plain and certain reason, to be
from no other than [τοττι God alone; for no propensity of the
will to any thing good can be found bnt in the elect. But the
cause of election must not be sought in men. Whenee we
may conclude, that man has not a good will from himself, but
that it proceeds from the same decree by which we were
elected before the creation of the world. There is also another
reason, not dissimilar. For since good volitions and good
actions both arise [τοττι saith, we must see whence saith itself
originales. Now, since the Scripture uniformly proclaims it to
be the gratuitous gift of God, it follows that it is the effect of
mere grace, when we, who are naturally and completely prone
to evil, begin to will any thing that is good. Theresore the
Lord, when he mentions these two things in the conversion of
his people, that he takes away from thern their stony heart,
and gives them a heart of flesh, plainly declares, that what
originates from ourselves must be removed, that we may be
converted to righteousness; and that whatever succeeds in its
place proceeds from himself. Nor is it only in one passage
that he announces this; for he says in Jeremiah, “ 1 will give
them one heart and one way, that they may fear me sor
ever.”›(·o)⁴ And a little after, “I will put my fear in their
hearts, that they shall not depart from me.'’ Again in Ezekiel,
“I will give them one heart, and will put a new spirit within
you; and l will take the stony heart out of their flesh, und
will give them a heart of flesh.'’ (p) He could not inore evi·

follows, that nothing 1good proceeds from our will till it lte
renovated; and that after its renovation, as far as it is good, it
is [τοττι God, and not from ourselves.

lX. And we find the saints have made this the subject of
their prayers. Solamen prayed, “May the Lord incline our
hearts unto him to keep his commandments.'’ (q) He shows
the stubbornness of our heart, which, unless a new bias be
given to it, naturally indulges itself in rebellion against the
Divine law. The same petition is offered by the Psalmist:
“ Incline my heart unto thy testimonias.'’ (r) For we should
always remark the opposition between the perverse bias of the
