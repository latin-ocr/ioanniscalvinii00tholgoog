self, and as it were retire within, that he may learn to submit
and humble himself, and to consess his misery. Since it was
necessary, therefore, both for our dulness and obstinacy, the Lord
gave us a written law, to declaro with greater certainty what
in the law of nature was too obscure, and by arousing our
indolence, to make a deeper impression on our understanding
and memory.

ΙΙ. Now, it is easy to perceive, what we are to leam from
the law; namely, that God, as he is our Creator, justly sustains
towards us the character of a Father and of a Lord; and that
on this account we owe to him glory and reverence, love and
fear. Morcover, that weare notat liberty to follow every
thing to which the violence of our passions may incite us3 but
that we ought to be attentive to his will, and to practise
nothing but what is pleasing to him. In the next place,
that righteousness and rectitudc arc a dclight, but iniquity an
abomination to him3 and that, therefore, unless we will with
impious ingratitude rebel against our Maker, we must necessa-
rily spend our whole lives in the practice of righteousness.
For if we manifest abecoming reverence for him, only when
we prefer his will to our own, it follows that there is no other
legitimate worship os him, but the observanee of righteousness,
sanctity, and purity. Nor can we pretend to excuse ourselves
by a want of ability, like insolvent debtors. For it is improper
for us to measure the glory of God by our ability; for what-
ever may be our characters, he ever remains like himself, the
friend of righteousness, the enemy of iniquity. Whatcver he
requires of us, since he can require nothing but what is right,
we are under a natural obligation to obcy; but our inability is
our own fault. For if we are bound by our own passions, which
are under the government of sin, so that we are not at liberty
to obey our Father, there is no reason why we should plead
this necessity in our, defence, the criminality of which is with-
in ourselvcs, and must be imputcd to us.

111. When we have made such a proficiency as this by
means of the instructiones the law, we ought, under the same
toacher, to retire within ourselves; frorn which we may leam
two things: First, by comparing our life with the righteousness
of the law, we shall find, that we are very far from acting
agreeably to the will of God, and are therefore unworthy to
retain a place among his creatures, much less to be nrrmbered
among his children. Secondly, by examining our strength,
we shall see, that it is not only unaqual te the observanee of
the law, but a mere nullity. 'Phe necessary consequence of
this will be a diffidence in our own strength, and an anxiety
and trepidationes mind. For the conscience cannot sustain
the load of iniquity, ,without an immediate discovery of the
