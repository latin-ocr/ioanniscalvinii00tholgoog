of the Lord, were extremely few; though, if estimated by
themselves without any comparisomlhey amounted to a oon·
siderable number.

IX. The fourth difference arises out of the third. For the
Scriptum calls the Old Testament a covenant of bondage, be·
cause it produces fear in the mind; but the New it describes
as a covenant of liberty, because it leads the heart to confidenoe
aud security. Thus Paul, in the eighth chapter of his Epistle
to the Romans, says, “Ye have not received the spirit of
bondage again to fear3 but ye have received the Spirit of adop
tion, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.’' (s ) Το the same pur·
pose is that passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews, that the
faithful now “are not corne unto the mount that might be
touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and
darkness, and tempest,” where nothing can be either heard or
seen, but what must strilre terror into the mind; so that even
Moses himself is exceedingly afraid at the sound of the terrible
voice, which they all pray that they may hear no more3 but
that now the faithful “are come unto mount Sion, and nuto
the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,”(g)&e.
What Paul briefly touches in the passage which we have
adduced from the Epistle to the Romans, he explains more at
large in his Epistle to the Galatians, when he allegorizes the
two sons of Abraham in the following manner-that Agar, the
hond-woman, is a type of mount Sinai, where the people of
Israel received the law ; that Sarah, the free-woman, is a figure
of the celestial Jerusalem, whence proceeds the gospel. That
as the son of Agar is born in bondage, and can never attain to
the inheritance, and the sonos Sarah is born free, aud has a
right to the inheritance, (h) so by the law we were devoted to
slavery, but by the gospel alone are regenerated to liberty.
Now, the whole may be summed up thus - that the Old Teste·
ment filled men’s consciences with fear and trembling; but
that by the benefit of the New Testament, they are delivered,
aud enabled to rejoice. The fo er lrept their consciences
under a yolse of severe bondage {adut by the liberality of the
latter they are emancipated and admitted to liberty. lf any
one object to us the case of the holy fathers of the Israelitish
people, that as they were clearly possessed of the same spirit
of faith as we are, they must consequently have been partakers
of the same liberty and joy, we reply, that neither of these
originated from the law ; but that, when they felt themselves,
by means of the law, oppressed with their servile condition,
aud wearied with disquietude of conscience, they fied for refugo
tothegospe13 and that therefore it was a peculiar advantage
