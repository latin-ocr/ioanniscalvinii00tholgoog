asa man. “ 'I'here is one Mediator,'’ he says, “between God
and man, theman Christ Jesus.” (a) He might have called
him God, or might indeed have omitted the appellation 01 man,
as well as that of God3 but because the Spirit, who spelte by
him, knew our infirmity, he has provided a very suitable
remedy against it, by placing the Son of God familiarly among
us, as though he were one of us. Therefore‚ that no one may
distress himself where he is to seek the Mediator, or in what
way he may approach him, the apostle, by denominating him
a man, apprizes us that he is near, and even close to us, since
he is our own flesh. He certainly intends the sameas is sta·
ted in another place more at large-“ that we have not a
high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our
infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet
without sin.'' (b)

ΙΙ. This will still more fully appear, if we consider, that it
was no mean part which the Mediator had to perforrn3 namely,
to restore us to the Divine favour, so as, of children of men, to
make us children 01 God3 01 heirs of hell, to make us heirs 01
the kingdom 01 heaven. Who could accomplish this, unless
the Son of God should become also the Son of marr, and thus
receive 10 himself what belongs to us, and transfer to us that
which is his, and make that which is his by nature ours by
grace? Depending‚ therefore, on this pledge, we have confi-
dence that we are the children from God, because he, who is the
Son of God by nature, has provided himself a body from our
body, flesh from our flesh, bones from our bones, (c) that he
might be the same with us: he refused not to assume that
which was peculiar to us, that we also might obtain that
which he had peculiar to him; and that so in common with
us 110 might be both the Son of God and the Son of man.
Hence arises that holy fraternity, which he mentions with his
own mouth in the following words: “ l ascend unto my Fa·
ther, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.” (d)
On this account we have a certainty of the inheritauce of the
kingdom of heaven, because the only Son of God, to whom it
exclusively belonged, has adopted usas his brethren ; and if
we are his brethren, we are consequently co-heirs 10 the inheri-
tauce. (e) Morcover it was highly necessary also for this
reason, that he who was 10 be our Redeemer should be truly
both God and man. lt was his office to swallow up death,
who could do this, buthe who was life itself? lt was his to
overcome sin; who could accomplish this, but righteousness
itself? lt was his 10 put to flight the powers of the world and
of the air3 who could do this, but a power superior both to
