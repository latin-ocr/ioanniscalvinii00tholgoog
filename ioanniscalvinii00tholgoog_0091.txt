pronouuced concaming his posterity, how does he disgrace his
own tribe! He even brands it, in the person os levi, with
perpetual iniamy. “Simeon’' says he, “and Levi, instru-
ments ol cruelty are in their habitatione. O my seul, come
not thou into their secret: unto their assembly, mine honour,
be not thou united.” (y) He certainly might have been silent
on that disgraceful circumstance, not only to spere his father,
but also to avoid aspersing himself, as well as all his family,
with part os the same ignominy. How can any suspicion be
entertained os him, who, voluntarily publishing, srom the in·
spiration of the Holy Spirit, that the lirst os tbe family from
which he was descended was guilty of detestable conduct,
neither consults his own personal honours, nor refuses to incur
the resentmeut of his relations, to whom this must undoubtedly
have given offence? When be mentions also the impious
murmurings os Aaron, his brother, and Miriam, his sister, (z)
shall we say that he spelte according to the dictales ot' the
fiesh, or obeyed the command ot' the Holy Spirit? Besides,
as he enjoyed the supreme authority, why did he not leave to
his own sons, at least, the office os the high-priesthood, but
place them in the lowest station? 1 only hiut at a few things
out os many. But in the law itsell many arguments will
every where occur, which challeuge a full belief, that, without
controversy, the legationes Moses was truly divine.

V. Moreover, the miracles which he relates, and which are
so numerous and remarkable, are so many confirmations os the
law which be delivered, and os the doctrine which bc pub-
lished. For that he was carried up into the mountain in a
cloud; that he continued there sorty days, deprived of all hu·
man intercourse; that, in the act ol proclaiming tholey, his
face shone as with the rays of the sun3 that lightnings flashed
all around3 that thnnders and various noises were heard
through the whole atmosphere; that a trumpet sounded, but
atrumpet not blowrr by human breath ; that the entrance os
the tabernacle was concealed srom the view os the people by
an intervening cloud; that his authority was so miraculously
‚vindicated by the horrible destructiones Korah, Dathan, and
Abiram, and all their impious saction3 that a roclr smitten
with a rod immediately emitted a river; that manna rained
from heaven at his request; (a)—are not all these so many tes·
timonies from heaven of his being a true prophet? ls any one
object that Ι assume, as granted, things which are the subjects
os controversy, this cavil is easily answered. For, as Moses
published all these things in an assembly of the people, what
room was there sor fiction among those who had been eye-
