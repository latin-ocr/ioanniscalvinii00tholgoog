Lord God; I do not this for your salies, but for mine holy
name’s salte) (d) lt suffices with respect to merit, to know
that merits are not sufficient, but as it suffices for merit not to
presumo on merite, so to be destitute of merits is sufficient
cause of condemnation.'' We must excuse bis custom of
' freely using the word meite for good works, But his ulti·
mate design was to terrify hypocrites, who indulge themselves
in a licentious course of sin against the grace of God; as he
presently declares: “Happy is the Church which wants
neither merits without presumption‚ nor presumption without
merita. lt has some ground of presumption‚ but not merits.
It has merits, but in order to deservo, not to presume. Is not
the absence of presumption itself a merit? Therefore the
Church presumes the more securely, because it does not pre·
sume, having ample cause sor glorying in the multitude of the
Divine mercios.’'

tv. This is the real truth. 'l'he troubled conscience finds
this to be the only asylum of safety, where it can enjoy any
tranquillity, when it has to do with the Divine justice. Foris
the stars, which appeared most brilliant during the night, lose
their splendour on the rising of the sun, what can we suppose
will be the case with the most excellent innocence of man,
when compared with the purity of God? For that will be
an examination inconceivably severe, which shall penetrate
into all the most secret thoughts of the beart, and, as Paul
says, “bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make
manifest the counsels ol' the hearts3 ” (e) which shall constrain
the reluctant conscience to consess all those things which have
now passed away even from our owu remembrance. We shall
be urged by an accusing devil, who hasbeen privy to all the
crimes which he has impelled us to perpetrate. There the ex·
ternal appearance of good works, which now is the sole object
of esteern, will be of no avail; sincerity of heart is all that will
be required. Wherefore hypocrisy, not only that by which a
man, conscious of his guilt before God, affecte ostentation before
men, bnt that also by which every man imposes on himself
before God, for we are all prone to sels-complaceney and adu·
lation ; hypocrisy in all its forms will then be overwhelmed with
confusion, however it may now be intoxicated with presump-
tion and pride. Persons who never loolt forward to suche
spectacla, may, indeed, delightsnlly and complacently composa
for themselves a temporary righteousnesS, of which they will
immediately be stripped at the Divine judgment; just asim·

we awake. But they who inquire seriously, and as in the pre- ,
sence of God, respecting the trne standard of righteousness,
will certainly find that all the actions of men, if estimated
