agreed in voluntarily obeying it; and that however Satan, to-
gether with the whole world, has endeavoured by strange
methodo to suppress or destroy it, or utterly to erase and oblit-
erate it from the memory os man, yet it has always, like a palm·
trec, risen superior to all opposition, and remained invincible.
Indeed‚ there has scarcely ever been asophist or orator os more
thau common abilities, who has not tried his strength in opposing
it; yet they have all availed nothing. All the powers of the
earth have armed themselves for its destmction; but their at·
tempts have all evaporated into smoke. How could it have so
firmly resisted attacks on every quarter, is it had been supported
only by human power? Indeed‚ an additional proos of its Di-
vina origin arises from this very circumstance, that, notwith-
standing all the strenuous resistance of men, it has, by its own
power, risen superior to every danger. Moreover, not one city,
or one aetion, only, has conspired to receive and embrace it;
but, as sar as the world extends, it has obtained its authority
by the holy consent of various natium, who agreed in nothing
besides. findas such an agreement os minds, so widely dis·
tant in place, and so completely dissimilar in manners and
opinions, ought to have great inllueuce with us, since it is plain
that it was affected only by the power of heaven, so it acquires
uo small weight from a consideration os the piety os those
who unite in this agreement; not indeed os all, but ot‘ those,
who, it hath pleased the Lord, should shiue as luminarios in
his Church.

Xlll. Now, with what unlimited confidence should we sub-
mit to that doctrine, which we sce confirmed and witnessed by
the blood of so many saints! Having once received it, they
hesitated not, with intrepid boldness, and even with great
' alacrity, to die in its descnce: transmitted to us with such a
pledge, how should we not receive it with a firm and unshaken
conviction? Is it therefore no small confirmation of the Scrip-
ture, that it has been sealed with the blood os so many martyrs?
especially when we consider that they died to bear testimony to
their saith, not through intemperato fanaticism, as is sometimes
the case with men of erroneous minds, but through a firm and
constant, yet sober zeal sor God. There are other reasons, and
those ncither sew nor weak‚ by which the native dignity and
authority os the Scriptura arc not only maintained in the minds
os the plone, but also completely vindicated against the subtleties
os calumniators; but such as alone are not sufficient to produce
firm saith in it, till the heavenly Father, discovering his own
power therein, places its authority beyond all controversy.
Wherefore the Scripture will then only be effectual to produce
the saving knowledge os God, when the certainty of it shall be
founded on tho internal persuasiones the Holy Spirit. Thus
