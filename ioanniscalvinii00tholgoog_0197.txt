our confident expectation of that reward. For how unim-
portant is it, to discover that the reward of eternal life depends
on the observance of the law, unless we also ascertain whether
it be possible for us to arrive at eternal life in that way! But
in this point the weakness of the law is manifest. Foras
none of usare found to observe the law, we are excluded from
the promises of lise, and fall entirely under the curse. lam
now showing, not only what does happen, but what necessa·
rily must happen. For the doctrine of the law being far
above human ability, man may view the promises, indeed, from
a distance, but cannot gather any fruit from them. It only
remains for him, from their goodness to form a truer estimate
of his own misery, while he reflects that all hope of salvation
is cut off, and that he is in imminent danger of death. On
the other hand, we are urged with terrible sanctione, which
bind, not a few of us, but every individual of mankind3 they
urge, I say, and pursue us with inexorable rigour, so that in
the law we see nothing but present death.

IV. Therefore, if we direct our views exclusively to the
law, the eflects upon our minds will only be despondency‚
confusion, and despair, since it condemns and curses us all,
and keeps us far from that blessedness which it proposes to
them who observa it. Does the Lord, then, you will say, in
this case do nothing but mock us? For how little does it
differ from ntockery, to exhibit a hope of felicity, to invite
and exhort to it, to declare that it is ready for our reception,
whilst the way to it is closed and inaccessible! 1 reply, al-
though the promises of the law, being conditional, depend on
a perfect obedience to the law, which can nowhere be found,
yet they haye not been given in vain. For when we have
learned that they will be vain and inefficacious to us, unless
uod embrace us with his gratuitous goodnesS, without any re-
gard to our works, and unless we have also embraced by saith
that goodness, as exhibited to us in the gospel,—then these
promises are not without their use, even with the condition
artnexed to them. For then he gratuitously confers every
thing upon us, so that he adds this also to the number of his
favours, that not rejecting our imperfect obedience, but par·
doning its deficiencieS, he gives us to enjoy the benefit of the
legal promises, just as if we had fulfilled the condition our-
selves. But as we shall more fully discuss this question when
we treat of the justificationes saith, we shall pursue it no
further at present.

V. Our assertion, respecting the impossibility of observing
the law, must be briefly explained and proved; for it is gene-
rally estcemed a very absurd sentiment, so that Jerome has not
scrupled to denounce it as accurscd. What was the opinion os
