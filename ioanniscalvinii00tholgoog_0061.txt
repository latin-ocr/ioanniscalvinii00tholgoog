CHAPTER 1v.

Wnrus experience testifies that the seeds of religion are sowa
by God in every heart, we scarcely find oue man in a hundred
who cherishes what he has received, aud not one in whom
they grow to maturity, much less bear fruit in due season.
Some perhaps grow vain iu their own superstitious, while
others revolt from God with intentional wickedness; but all
degenerata from the true knowledge of him. The fact is, that
no genuine piety remains in the world. But, in saying that
some fall into superstition through error, 1 would not insinuate
that their ignorance excuses thern from guilt; because their
blindness is always connected with pride, vanity, and contu·
macy. Pride and vanity are discovered, when miserable meu,
in secking after God, rise not, as they ought, above their own
level, but judge of him according to their carnal stupidity, aud
leave the proper path of investigation in pursuit of speculatione
as vain as they are curicus. Their conceptions of him are
formed, not according to the representatione he gives of him·
self, but by the inventious of their own presumptuous imagina-
tione. 'I'his gulf being opened, whatever course they take,
they must be rushing forwards to destruction. Noue of their
subsequeut attempta for the worship or service of God can be
considered as rendered to him3 because they worship not him,
but a figment of their own brains iu his stead. This depravity
Paul expressly remarks: “ Professing themselves to be wisa,
they became fools.” (lc) He had before said, “they became
vain in their imaginations.'’ But lest any should exculpate
them, he adds that they were deservedly blinded, because,
not content within the bounds of sobriety, but arrogating to
themselves more than was right, they wilsully darkened, and
even infatuated themselves with pride, vanity, and perverse·
ness. Whenee it follows, that their folly is inexcusable, which
originates not only in a vain curiosity, but in false confidence,
and an immoderate desire to excecd the limita of human
knowledge.
