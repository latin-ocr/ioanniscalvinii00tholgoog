or make them portahers of faith, and ou those to whom he im·
parts it he does uot ordinarily bestow it without means, bnt
employs for this purpose the preaching of the Gospel and the
use of the sacramente, with the administration of all discipline,
therefore it follows in the Oreed, “l believe in the Holy Cath-
olio Ohurch,” whom, though involved in etemal death, yet, in
prusuanoe of the gratuitous electiou, God has freely reconciled
to himself iu Christ, and made partahers of the Holy Spirit,
that, being ingrafted into Christ, they may have communion
with him as their head, whence flows a perpetual remission of
sins, and a full restoration to eternal life.

So in the fourth book our Author treats of the Church -theu
of the means used by the Holy Spirit in effectually calling from
spiritual death, and preserving the church -the word and sao·
ramento-baptism and the Lord’s supper-which are as it
were Christ's regal sceptro, by which he commences his spir·
itual reign in the Ohurch by the euergy of his Spirit, and car·
ries it forwerda from day to day during the present life, after
the close of which he perfecte it without those means.

Aud as political institutione are the asylums of the Ohurch
iu this life, though civil government is distinct from the spir
itual kingdom of Christ, our Author instructo ns respecting it
as a signal blessing of God, which the Church ought to ac·
knowledge with gratitudo of heart, till we are called out of
this transitory state to the heavenly inheritance‚ where God
will be all iu 111.

This is the plau of the Institutes, which may be comprised
in the following brief summary : -

Man, created originally upright, being afterwards ruined‚ not
partially, but totally, finds salvatiou out of himself, wholly in
Christ3 to whom being united by the Holy Spirit, freely be-
stowed, without any regard of future works, he enjoys iu him
a twofold benefit, the perfect imputatiou of righteousness‚ which
atteuds him to tho grave, aud the commenccmeut of sanctifica·
tion, which he daily increaseS, till at length he completes it at
the day of regeneration or resurrection of the body, so that in
eternal life and the hoavenly inheritance his praises are cele·
brated for such stupendous mercy.
