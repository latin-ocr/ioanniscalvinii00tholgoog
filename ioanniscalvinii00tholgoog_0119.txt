gate of the Eeeteru churches, carried by the servour ol his
zeal to still greater lengths, asserto it to be better to admit all
the brothele os the world into one city, than to reject the
worship of images. At length it was unanimously decreed,
that the Samaritana were worse than all heretice, and that the
adversariosos imeges were worse than the Samaritans. But,
that the fasce might not want ite usual plaudit, they add thie

in disorder end confusion. Although Cicero ingeniously and
correctly derives the word religion from a verb siguisying
“to read over again,'’ cr “to gether again;’' yet the rea·
eon he assigns sor it, that good worshippers osten recollect,
and diligently reconeider what is true, is forced and sar-felched.
lrather think the word is opposed to a liberty os wandering
without restraint3 because the greater pert of the world raehly
embrace whatever they meet with, and eleo ramble from one
