'I'his monstrans supposition, which all picus persons justly ab·
hor and detest, Osiander excuses under this pretext, that it is
nowhere in Scriptnre expressly condemncd; as if, when Paul
esteems nothing valuable or worthy of being known but Christ
crucified, he would admit an assio be the author of salvationi
· Therefore he who in another place declares that Christ was ap-
pointed hythe eternal decree of the Father as “ the head
over all,’' (g) would never aclmowledge any other who had not
been appointed to the office of a Redeemer. ⁴

Vl. But the principle which he boasts is altogether fri-
volons. He maintains that man was created in the image of
God, because he was formed in the similitude of the future
Messiah‚ that he might resemble him whom the Father had
already decreed to clothe with flesh, Whence he concludes
that if Adam had never fallen from his primitive integrity,
Christ would nevertheless have become man. How nugatory
and forced this is, all who possess a sonnd judgment readily
perceive. But he supposes that he has been the first to dis·
cover wherein the Divina image consisted3 namely, that the
glory of God not only shone in those eminent talents with
which man was endued‚ bnt that God himself essentially re·
sided in him. NoW, though l admit that Adam bore the Di·
vine image, inasmuch as he was united to God, which is the true
and consummate perfectiori of dignity, yet Icontend that the
similitude of God is to be sought only in those characters of
excellence, with which God distinguished Adam above the
other creatures. And that Christ was even then the image of
God, is universally allowed3 and therefore whatever excellence
was impressed on Adam proceeded from this circumstance, that
hc approached to the glory of his Malter by means of his only
begotten Son. Man, therefore, was made in the image of God,
arrd was designed to be a minor to display the glory of his
Creator. He was exalted to this degree of honour hy the·
favour of the only begotten Son; but l add, that this Son was
a common head to angels as well as to men3 so that the angele
also were entitled to the same dignity which was conferred on
man. And when we hear them called the “children of
God,'’ (h) it would be unreasonable to deny that they have
some resemblance to their Father. But if he designed his
glory to be represented in angels aa well as in men, and to be
equally conspicuous in the angelic as in the human nature,
Osiander betrays his ignorance and folly in saying that men
were preferred to angels, because the latter did not bear the
image of Christ. For they could not constantly enjoy the
present contemplationes God, unless they were like him. And
