serred. So, also, what ample occasion he supplies us sor the
considerationes his mercy, while, with unwearied benignity,
he pursues the miserebis, calling thern back to himself with
more than paternal indulgence, till his beneficence overcomes
their depravity l

VIII. To this end the Psalmist, (g) mentIoning that God,
in desperate cases, suddenly and wonderfully succors, beyond
all expectation,those who are miserable and ready to perish,
either protecting from beasts os prey such as are wandering iu
deserte, and, at length, reconducting thern luto the right way,
or supplying with food the needy and hungry, or delivering
captives from dreary dungeone and iron chains, or bringing the
shipwrecked sese into port, or healing the disenses of some
who are almost dead, or scorchiug the earth with excessivo
heat and drought, or sertilizing it with the secret showers os
his merny, or elevating the meanest os the vulgar, or degrnding
nobles from their dignified stations, -the Psalmist, Isay, havIng
proposed such examples as these, infers from them that what
are accounted fortuitous accidente, are so many prooss os his
heavenly providence, especially os his paternal clemency; and
that hence the picus have cause to rejoice, while the mouths os
the impious and reprobate are stopped. But, since the majority
of men, immersed in their errors, are blind amidst the greatest
opportunities of seeing, he accounts it a rare instance of siu-
gular wisdom discreetly to consider these works os God; (b)
from the sight of which, sorne, who, in other instances, discover
the greatest acuteness, receive no benefit. And, notwithstand-
ing all the displays os the glory os God, scarcely one man in a
hundred is really a spectator os it. His power and wisdom are
- equally conspicuous. His power is illustriously marrisested,
when the ferocity os the impious, universally deamed insuper·
able, is quelled in an instant, their arrogance snbdned, their
strongest fortresses demolished, their weapons and armour
broken in pleces, their strength diminished, their machinations
conforrnded, and they sall by their own exertions; when the
audacity, which exalted itsels above the heavens, is thrown
. down to the centre os the earth; when, on the contrary, “the
poor are raised out os the dust, and the needy out os the dung·
hill;’' (i) the oppressed und afflicted extricated frorn distress-
ing extremities, and the desperate restored to a good hope ;
when the unarmed are victorious over those who are enned,
the few over the many, the week over the strong. But his
wisdom is eminently displayed in ordering every dispensation
attho best possible time, consounding the greatest worldly
sagacity, “taking the wise in their own crastiness,’'(lc) and
