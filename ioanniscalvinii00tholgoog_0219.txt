vain and frivolous in the sight of God. We essert also that it
is the source and soul of righteousness; because men are
taught by it 13 live temperately and justly with one another,if
they venerate God 33 1113 judge of right and wrong. 111 1113
first table, therefore, he instructs us in piety and the proper

duties of religion, in which his majesty isto be worshipped3 in
the second he prescribes the duties which the fear of his name
should excite us to praetise in society. For this reason our
Lord, as the evangeliste inform us, (3) summarily comprised the
whole law in two principa} points- 11131 we love God with all
3111 113311, with 311 3111 33111, and with all our strength3 and
that we love our neighbour 33 ourselves. Of the two parts in
which he compreheuds 1113 whole law, we see how he directa
one towards God, and assigna the other to men.

XII. But, although the whole law is contained in these two
principa} points, yet our God, in order to remove every pretext
of excuse, has been pleased in the ten commandments more
diffusely and explicitly to declare, 33 well those things which
relate to our honour, love, and fear of him, as those which per·
tain to that charity, which he commende us sor his sake 13 ex·
ercise towards men. Nor is it a useless study to examine into
the division of the commandments; provided you remember it
is asubject os such a nature, that every man ought to be at
liberty to judge of it, and 11131 we ought 1131 contentiously 13
oppose any who may differ from us respecting it. But we are
undere necessity 31 touching on this topic, lest the reader
should despise or wonder 31 1113 division that we shall adopt,
as a novel invention. That the lewis divided into 1311 precepts,
is beyond all controversy, being frequently established by the
authority 31 God himself. The question, therefore, is not 3311-
coming the number 31 1113 precepts, but concerning the manner
of dividing them. These who divide thom, so as to assign three
precepts to 1113 first table, andicavo the remaining seven to the
second, expungo from the number the precept concerning
images, 31 31 least conceal it under the first, whereas it is
undoubtedly delivered by the Lnrd asa distinct commandment.
But the tenth, against coveting the property os our neighbour,
they improperly divide into two. We shall 333 presently
that such a method 31 division was unknown in purer ages.
Others rcckon with us four articles in the first table; but
the first commandment they consider as a simple promise,
without a precept. Now, 1 understand the “ten words'’
mentioned by Moses 13 beten precepts; and Ι think Ι 333
11131 number disposed in the most beautiful order. And
therefore, unless 1 3111 convinced by clear argument, leaving
