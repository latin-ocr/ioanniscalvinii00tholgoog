one in the cloistere of the schoole, to indulge himself in idle
speculatione on the meritos werke to justify men3 but when
he comes into the presence of God, he must bid sarewell ιο
these amusements, forthere the business is transacted with
seriousness, and no ludicrous logomachy practieed. 'I'o this
point, then, must our attention be directed, if we wish ιο, make
any useful inquiry concerning true righteousnese3 how we
cau answer the celestial Judge, when he shall call us ιο ιιι
account. Let us place that Judge before our eyes, not accord-
ing to the spontaneous imaginatione of our minds, but ac·
cording ιο the descriptione given of himin the Scriptura,
which represents him ae one whose refulgence eclipses the
stare, whose power melts the mountains‚ whose anger shakes
the earth, whose wisdom takes the eubtle in their own crasti-

how much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose
foundation isin the dnst, which are crnshed before the moth?
They are destroyed from morning to evening.” (rt) Again:
“Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints3 yea, the heavens
are not clean in hie eight, how much more abominable and·
filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?''(w) 1
