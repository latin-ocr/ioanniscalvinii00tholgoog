prophete, that Christ might be manifested in due time? By his
most inveterate enemies, the Jews3 whom Augustinc therefore ·
justly denominates the librarians of the Christian Church, bo-
causs they have furnished ns with a book of which themselves
miilnifuiis proceed to the Now Testament, by what solid ¹

foundations is its truth supported? 'l'hree Evangelists recita
their history in a low and mean style. Many proud men are
disgusted with that simplicity, because they attend not to the
principal points of doctrins; whence it were easy to infer, that
they treet of heavenly mysteries which are above human ca-
pacity. They who have a spark of ingennous modesty will
certainly be ashnmed, if they peruse the first chapter of Luto,
Now, the discourses of Christ, a concise summary of which is
comprised in these three Evangelists, easily exempt their wri-
tings from contempt. But John, thundering fromhis sublimity,
more powerfully than any thunderbolt, levels to the dust the
obstinacy of those whom he does not compel to the obediencs
of saith. Let all those censorious critice whose supreme plsa-
sure consists in banishing all reverence for the Scripturs out
of their own hearts and the hearts of others, come forth to pub·
lic view Let them read the Gospel of John: whether they
wish it or not, they will there find numerous passages, which,
at least, arouse their indolence, and which will even imprint
a horrible brand on their consciences to restrain their ridicule.
Similar is the method of Paul and of Peter, in whose writings,
though the greater part be blind, yet their heavenly majesty
attracts universal attention. But this one circumstance raises
their doctrine sufficiently above the world, that Matthew, who
had before been confined to the profit of his table, and Peter
arrd John, who had been employed in fishing-boats, - all plain,
unlettered men-had learned nothing in any human school
which they could communicate to others. And Paul, from not
only aprofessed, but a cruel and sanguinary enemy, being
converted to a new man, proves, by his sudden and unhoped for
change, that he was constrained, by a command from heaven,
to vindicate that doctrine which he had before opposed. Let
these men deny that the Holy Spirit descended on the Apos-
tles3 or, at least, let them dispute the credibility of the history;
yet the fact itself loudly proclaims, that they were taught by
the Spirit, who, though before despised as some of the meanest
of the people, suddenly began to discourse in such a magnifi-
cent manner on the mysteries of heaven.

XII. Resides, there are also other very substantial reasons
why the consent os the Chnrch should have its weight. For
it is not an unimportant consideration, that, since the publication
of the Scriptura, so many generations of men should have
