subscribes-“ 'I'hat they who first introduced images of the
gods, removed fear and added error.'’ lf this had been a
mere assertiones Varro alone, it might have perhaps but little
authority; yet it should justly fill us with shame, that a
heathen, groping as it were in the dark, attained so much
light as to perceive that corporeal representations were un·
worthy of the Divine Majesty, being calculated ¹to diminish
the fear of God, and to increase error among mankind. The
fact itself demonstratas this to have been spoken with equal
truth and wisdom; but Angustiae, having borrowed it from
Varro, advances it as his own opinion. And first he observes
that the most ancient errors concaming God, in which men
were involved, did not originale from images, but were in-
creased by them, as by the superaddition of new materiola.
He next explains that the fear of God is thereby diminished,
and even destroyed, since the foolish, ridiculous, and absurd
fabrication of idols would easily bring his Divinity into con·
tempt. Of the truth of this second remark, l sincerely wish
that we had not such proofs in our own experience. Who·
ever, therefore, desires to be rightly instmcted, ha must leam
from some other quartas than from images, what is to be known
concerning God.

Vll. lf the papists have any shame, let thern no longer use
this subterfuge, that images are the books of the illiterate;
which is so clearly refuted by numerous testimonias from
Scriptura. Yet, though Ι should concede this point to them,
it would avail them but little in deferrce of their idols. What
monsters they obtrude in the place of Deity is well known.
But what they call the picturas or statues of their saints- '
what are they but examples of the most abandoned luxury
and obscenity? which if any one were desirous of imitating,
he would deserve corporal punishment. Even prostitutes in
brothels are to be seen in more chaste and modest attire, than
those images in their temples, which they wish to be account·
cd images of virgins. Nor do they clothe the martyrs in
habits at all more becoming. Lot them adorn their idols, then,
with some small degree of modesty, that the pretence of their
being books of some balineas, if not less false, may be less
impudent. But even then, we will reply, that this is not the
method to be adopted in sacred places for the instmction
of the faithful, whom God will have taught a very different
doctrine from any that cau be learned from such insignificant
trilles. He hath commanded one common doctrine to be there
proposed to all, in the preaching of his word, and m his sacred
mysteries; to which they betray great inattention of mind,
who are carried about by their eyes to the contemplation of

idols. Whom, theu. do the papists call illiterata, whose ig·
