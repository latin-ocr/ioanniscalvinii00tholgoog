tortured‚ others escape by flight; but we are all reduced to
extreme perplexities, execrated with dreadful cumas, oruelly
slandered, and treated with the greatest indignities Now,
look at our adversaries, (1 speak of the order of priests, at
whose will and directions others carry ou these hostilities
against us,) and consider a little with me by what principles
they are actuated. The true religion, which is taught in the
Scripturas, and ought to be universelly maintained, they readily
permit both themselves and others to be ignorant of, end te
treet with neglect and contempt. They think it uuimportant
what any one holds or denies concerning God and Christ, pro·
vided he submits his mind withan implicit faith (as they call
it) to the judgment of the Church. Nor are they much af·
fected, if the glory of God happens to be violated with open
blasphemias, provided no one lift a fruger against the primacy
of the Apostolic See, and the authority of their holy Mother
Church. Why, therefore, do they coutend with such extreme
bitterness and cruelty for the mass, purgatory‚ pilgrima'ges, and
similar trifles, and deny that any piety can be maintained with·
out a most explicit saith, so to speak, iu these things; whereas
they prove none of them from the Word of Godl Why, but
because their belly is their god, their kitchen is their religi0n;
deprived of which they consider themselves no longer as
Christians, ereren as men. For though some feast themselves
in splendour, and others subsist on slender fare, yet all live on
the same pot, which, without this fuel, would not only coel,
but completely fraere. Every one of them, therefore, who is
most solicitous for his belly, is found to be a most strenuous
champion for their felth. Indeed‚ they universelly exart them·
selves for the preservation of their kingdom, and the repletion
of their bellies3 but not one of them discovers the least iudi·
cation of sincere real.

Nor do their attacks on our doctrine ccase here; they urge
every topic of accusation and abuse to render itan object of
hatred or suspicion. They call it novel, and of recent origin,
-they cavil at it as doubtful and uncertain,-they inquire
by what miracles it is confirmed—they ask whether it is
right for it to be received contrary to the consent of so many
holy fathers, and the custom of the highest antiquity, -they
