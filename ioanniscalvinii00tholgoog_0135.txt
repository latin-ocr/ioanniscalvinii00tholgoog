in adifferent manner, and for a different end; yet he cannot
attempt any thing but by the Divine will. Although he seems
to obtain only a bare permission to afflict that holy man, yet,
since this sentence is tnre, “The Lord gave, and the Lord
hath taken away,'' (z) we conclude that God was the author
of that trial, of which Satan and mischievous robbers and
assassins were the immediate agents. Satan endeavours to
drive him by desperation into madness. The Sabeans, in a
predatory incursion, emelly and wickedly seiae upon property
not their own. Job acknowledges that he was stripped of all
his wealth, and reduced to poverty, because such was the will

os God. Therefore, whatever is attempted by men, or by
Satan himself, God still holds the helm, to direct all their at·

’ , tempta to the execution of his judgmcnts. God intends the

deception of that perfidious king Ahab ; the devii offers his
service for that purpose; he is sent with a positive commission
to be a lying spirit in the mouth os all the prophets.(o) lf
the blinding and infatuation of Ahab be a Divine judgment, the
pretence of bare permission disappears. For it would be ridic-
ulous for ajudge merely to permit, without decreeing what
should be done, and commarrding his officers to execute it.
The Jews designed to destroy Christ3 Pilate and his soldiers
'complied with their outrageous violence; yet the disciples, in
a solemn prayer, confess that all the impious did nothing but
what “the hand and the cnunsel of God determined before to
be done;'’(b) agreeably to what Peter had already preached,
that he was “delivered by the determinate counsel and fore·
knowledge of God,” that he might be “crucihad and slain.” (c)
As though he had said that God, who saw every thing from
the beginning, with a clear knowledge and determined will,
appointed what the Jews executed3 as he mentions in another
place: “These things which God before had shewed by the
mouth os all his propheta, that Christ should suffer, he hath so
fulfilled.’'(d) Absalom, defiling his father's bed with incest,
perpetrated a detestablc crime; yet God pronounces that this
was his work; for his words are, “Thou didst it secretly3
but Iwill do this thing before all lsrael, and before the
suu.”(e) Whatever cruelty the Chaldeans exercised in Judea
Jererniah pronounces to be the work of G0d;(s) for which
reason Nebuchadnezzar is called the servant of God. God
frequently proclaims, that the impious are excited to war by
his hissing, hythe sound of his trumpet, by his influence, and
by his command: he calls the Assyrian the rod of his anger,
and the staff which he moves with his hand The destruction
