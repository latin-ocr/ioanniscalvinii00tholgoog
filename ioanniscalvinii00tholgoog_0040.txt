wc shall not be much afraid. For, whether many ages agree
in similar impiety, he is mighty to take vongeance on 1110 third

and fourth generation; or whether the whole world combine in
1110 same iniquity, he has given an example 01 the fatal end of
those who sin with a multitude, by destroying all men with a
delugc, and preserving Noah and his small family, in order that
his individual faith might condemn the whole world. Lastly,
a corrupt custom is nothing but an epidemical pestilenoe, which
ia equally fatal to its objecto, though they fall with 0 multitude.
Besides, they ought to consider a remark, somewhere made by
Cyprian, (m) that persons who sin through ignorance, though
they cannot be wholly exculpated, may yet be considered in
some degree excusable3 but those who obstinately reject the
trnth offered by the Divina goodneas, arc without any excusa

“even 10 the ond 01 the world.''(n) We have no quarrel
against 1110 Church, for with one consent we unite with all the
company 01 the faithful in worshipping and adoring the one
God and Christ the Lord, as he has been adored by all the pions
inall ages. But our opponents deviato widely from 1110 truth
when they aclrnowledge no Church but what is visible to the
corporeal eye, and endeavour to circumscribe it by those limits
within which it is far from being included. Our controversy
turns ou the two following points : — first, they contend that the
form of the Church is always apparent and visible3 secondly,
they place that forrn in the see of the Roman Ohurch and her
order of prelates. We assert, on the contrary, first, that the
Church may exist without any visible form, secondly, that its
form is not contained in that external splendour which they 1001-
