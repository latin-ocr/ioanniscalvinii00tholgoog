hain, that they might be added to his people; but by that
public vocadon, the Gentiles were not only raised to au equal-
ity with the Jews, but appeared to succced to their places as
though they had been dead. Resides, of all the strangers
whom God had before incorporated into the Ohurch, none
were ever placed on an equality with the Jews. 'Pherefore
it is not without reason that Paul so celebrates this “mys-
tery which was hidden from ages and from generations,’' (a)
and which he represents as an object of admiration even to

XIILyin these four or five points, 1 think 1 have given a
correct and faithful statement of the whole of the difference
between the Old and the New Testament, as far as is sufficient
for asimple system of doctrine. But because some persons re·
present this variety in the government of the Church, these dif-
ferent modes of instmction‚ and such aconsiderable alteration of
rites and ceremonias, as a great absurdity, we must reply to
them, before we proceed to other subjecta. And this may be
done in a brief manner, since the objections are not so strong
as to require a laborious refutation. Itis not reasonable, they
say, that God, who is perpetually consistent with himself,
should undergo so great a change aa afterwards to disallow
what he had once enjoined and commanded. 1 reply, that God
ought not therefore to be deerned mutable, because he has ac·
commodated different forms to different ages, as he knew
would be suitable for each. If the husbandmen prescribes
different employments to his family in the winter, from those
which he allots them in the summer, we must not therefore
accuse him of inconstancy, or impute to him a deviation frorn
the proper rules of agriculture, which are connected with the
perpetual course of nature. Thus, also, if a father instructa,
governs, and manages his children one way in infancy, another
in childhood, and another in youth, we must not therefore
charge him with being inconstant, or forsakiug his own de-
signs. Why, then, do we stigmatize God with the character of
inconstancy, because he has made an apt and suitable distinc-
tion between diflerent times? The last similitude ought fully
to satisfy us. Paul compares the Jews to children, and Chris·
tians to youths. (z) What impropriety is there in this part of
the government of God, that he detained them in the rudimenta
which were suitable to them on account of their age, but has
placed us under a stronger and more manly discipline? lt isa
proof, therefore, of the constancy of God, that he has delivered
the same doctrine in all ages, and perseveres in requiring the
same worship of his name which he commanded from the
