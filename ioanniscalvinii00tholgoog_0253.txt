· intention, aa we have before observed in explaining the former

commandments, is a deliberate consent of the will, when the
mind has been enslaved by any unlawsul desire. Concupis-
cence may exist without such deliberation or consent, when
the mind is only attracted and stimulated by vain and corrupt
objects. As the Lord‚ therefore, has hitherto commanded our
willa, efforts, and actions to be subject to the law of love, so
now he directe that the conceptions of our minds be subject to
the same regulation, lest any of them bc corrupt and perverted,
and give our hearts an improper impulse. As hohas forbidden
our minds to be inclined and persuaded to anger, hatred,
adultery, rapine, and falsehood, so now he prohibits thern from
being instigated to these vices.

L. Nor is it without cause that he requires such consummate
rectitude. For who can deny that it is reasonable for all the
powers os our souls to be under the intluence of love? But if
any one deviato from the path of love, who can deny that that
aoul is in an unhealthy state? Now, whence is it, that your
mind conceives desires prejudicial to your neighbour, but that,
neglecting his interest, you consult nothing but your own ? For
if your heart were full of love, there would be no partos it
exposed to such imaginatione. lt must therefore be destitute
of love, so far as it is the seat of concupiscence. Some one
will object, that it is unreasonable, that imaginations, which
without reflection flutter about in the mind, and then vanish
away, should be condemned as symptoms of concupiscence,
which has its seat in the heart. Ireply, that the present ques·
tion relates to that kind of imaginations, which, when they are
presented to our understandings, at the same time strike our
hearts, and inflame them with cupidity; since the mind never
entertains a wish for any thing after which the heart is not ex·
cited to pant. Theresore God enjoins a wonderful ardour of
love, which he will not allow to be interrupted even by the
smallest degree os concupiscente. He requires a heart adrni-
rably well regulated, which he permits not to be disturbed
with the least emotion contrary to the law of love. Do not
imagine that this doctrine is uusupportcd by any great au-
thority; for I derived the first idea of it from Augustine.
Now, though the design of the Lord was to prohibit us from all
corrupt desires, yet he has exhibited, as examples, those ob·
jecta which most generally deceive us with a fallacious ap-
pearance of pleasure3 that he might not leave any thing to
concupiscence, after having driven it from those objects towards
which it is most violently inclined. Behold,then,the second
table of the laW, which sufficiently instructa us in the duties
we owe to men for the sake of God, 011 regard to whom
the whole rule of love depends. The duties taught in this
