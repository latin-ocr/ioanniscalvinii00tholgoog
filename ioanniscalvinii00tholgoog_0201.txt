mecours us without the assistance of the law, is rendered
sweeter3 and his mercy, which confers it on us, more amiable;
from which we learn that he is never wearied with repeating
his blessings and leading us with new favours.

VIII. But though the iniquity and condemnationes us all
are confirmed by the testimony of the law, this is not done (at
least if we properly profit by it) in order to make us sink into
despair, and fall over the precipice of despondency. It is true
that the wicked are thus confounded by it, but this is occa-
sioned by the obstinacy of their hearts. With the children of
God, its instructions must terminato in a different manner.
The Apostle indeed declares that we are all condemned by the
sentence of the law, “that every mouth may be stopped, and
all the world may beoonm guilty before God.” (l) Yet the
same Apostle elsewhere infomrs us, that “God hath concluded
them all in unbelief,'’ not that he might destroy or suffer all to
perish‚ but “that he might have mercy upon all; '' (m) that is,
that leaving their foolish opinion of their own strength, they
may know that they stand andare supported only by the
power of God3 that being naked and destitute, they may resort
for assistance to his merey, recline themselves wholly upon it,
hide themselves entirely in it, and embrace it alone for right-
eousness and merits, since it is offered iu Christ to all who with
true saith implore it and expect it. For in the precepts of the
law, God appears only, on the one hand,as the rewarder of per·
feet righteousness, of which we are all destitute; arrd on the
other, as the severe judge of transgressions. But in Christ, hie
face shines with a plenitude of grace and lenity, even towards
miserable and unworthy sinners.

IX. Of making use of the law to implore the assistance of
God, Angustiae frequently treats ; as when he writes to Hilary:
‘⁴ The law gIves commanda, in order that, endeavouring to
perform thern, and being wearied through our infirmity under
the law, we may leam to pray for the assistance of grace.''
Also to Asellius: “ The utility of the law is to convince man
of his own infirmity, and to compel him to pray sor the gra·
eious remedy provided in Christ.'’ Also to Innocentius Ro·
manus: “ 'Phe law commanda: grace furnishes strength sor the
performanco.” Again, to Valentine: “ God commende what
we cannot perform, that we may know for what blessings we
ought to supplicate him.'' Again: “'I'he law was given to
convict you ς that being convicted you might sear, that fearing
you might pray for pardon, and not presume on your own
strength.’' Again: “The end for which the law was given,
wasto diminish that which was great, to demonstrate that you
