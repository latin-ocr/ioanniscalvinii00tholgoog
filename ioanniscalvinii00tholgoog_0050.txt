aon-'Phat the office of Christ, appointed for the acquisition
aud application of complete salvation by his merit and edicacy,
issacerdotal, regal, anti prophetical. -Next follows the man·
ner in which Christ executed his office, or actually performed
the part of a Mediator, being an exposition of the Articles re·
specting his death, resurrection, and ascension to heaven.-
Lastly, the Author shows the truth and propriety of affirming
that Christ merited the grace of God and salvation for us.

111. As long as Christ is separate from us, he profits us
nothing. Hence the necessity of our being ingrafted into him,
as branches into a vine. Therefore the doctrine concerning
Christ is followed, in the third part of the Creed, by this clause,
“1 believe in the Holy Spirit,'’ as being the bond of union
