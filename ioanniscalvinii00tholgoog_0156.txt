were a mutual concurrence from the respective exertions of
each3 but that he only designatas the multiplicatiou of grace.
To the same purpose is what he elsewhere essens, that the
good will of man precedes many of the gifts of God, but is
itself one of their number. Whence it follows, that he leaves
nothing for it to arrogata to itsolf. This is also particularly
expressed by Paul. For having said that “it is God which
worketh in us both to will and to do,'' (s) he immediately
adds, that he does both “ of his own good pleasure‚'' signifying
by this expression that these are acts of gratuitous benignity.
Now, to their wonted assertion, that after we have admitted the
first grace, our own endeavours coiiperate with the grace which
follows, I reply, if they mean that, aster having been once
subdned by the Divino power to the obedience of righteousness,
we voluntarily advance, and are disposed to follow the gui·
dance of grace, Ι make no objection. For it is very certain, that
where the grace of God reigns, there is such a promptitude of
obedience. But whence does this arise but from the Spirit
of God, who, uniformly consistent with himself, cherishes and
strengthens toa constancy of perseverance that disposition of
obedience which he first originated? But if they mean that
man derives from himself an ability to coiiperate with the
grace of God, they are involved in a most pestilent error.

Xll. And to this purpose thoy falsely and ignorantly pervert
that observation of the Apostle, “l laboured more abundantly
thau they all; yet not l, but the grace of God which was with
me.” (g) For they understand it in this manner, that because
his preference of himself to all others might appear rather too
arrogant, he corrects it by referring the praise to the grace of
God; but yet so as to denominate himself a cooperator with
grace. Itis surprising that so many men, not otherwise erro·
neone, have stumbled at this irnaginary difficulty. For the
Apostle does not say that the grace of God laboured with him,
to make himself a partncr in the labour; but rather by that
correction ascribes the whole praise of the labour to grace
alone. “lt is not l,'' says he, “that have laboured, but the
grace of God which was with me.'' They have been deceived
by an ambiguity of expression; but still more by a preposte-
rous translation, in which thc force of the Greek article is omit·
ted. For if you translate it literally‚ he says, not that grace
was cooperative with him, but that the grace which was with
him was the author of all. And the same is maintained by
Augustius, though briefly, yet without obscurity, when he
thus expresses himself: “The good will of man precedes
many of the gifts of God, but not all. But of those which it
