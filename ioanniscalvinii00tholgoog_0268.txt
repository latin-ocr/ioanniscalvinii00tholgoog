III. In discussing the first point, therefore, because it princi·
pally belongs to the present argument, and is the grand subject
of their controversy against us, we will use the more diligent
application3 yet in such a manner, that if any thing be wanting
to the explication of the others, it may be supplied as we pro·
ceed, or added afterwards in asuitable place. Indeed, the apostle
removes every doubt respecting all these points, when he says,
that God the Father “ promisedafore by his propheta iu the holy
Scripturas, the gospel concerning his Son,’' (s) which he pro·
mulgated in the appointed time: and again, that the righteous·
ness of felth, which is revealed in the gospel, is “witnessed by
the law and the prophets.'' (t) For the gospel does not detain
men in the joy of the present life, but elevatas them to the
hope of immortality; does not fasten them to terrestrial de·
lights, but announcing to them a hope reserved iu heaven, does
as it were transport thern thither. For this is the description
which he gives in another place: “ In whom also after that ye
believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise,
which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption
of the purchased possession.'' (c) Again: “We heard of your
saith in Christ Jesus‚ and of the love which ye have to all the
saints, for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, where·
of ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel.'’ (w)
Again: “ He called you by our gospel, to the obtaining oi the
glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (r) Whence it is called “the
word of salvation,'‘ and “the power of God to the salvation
of believers,’' and “ the kingdom of heaven.’' Now, if the
doctrine of the gospel be spiritual, and open a way to the pos-
session of an immortal life, let us not suppose that they, to
whom it was promised and announced, were totally negligent
and careless of their souls, end stupefied in the pursuit of
corporeal pleasures. Nor let any one here cavil, that the pro·
mises which are recorded in the law and the prophete, respect-
ing the gospel, were not designed for the Jews. For just after
having spoken of the gospel being promised in the law, hs
adds, “that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them
who are under the law.” (y) This was in another argument,
Igrant; but when he said that whatever the law inculcatas
truly belonged to the Jews, he was not so forgetful as not to re·
member what he had affirmed, a few verses before, concerning
the gospel promised in the law. By declaring that the Old
Testament contained evangelical promises, therefore, the
apostle most clearly demonstrares that it principally related to
afutura life.
