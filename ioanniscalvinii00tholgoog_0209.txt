lossians he treats of a sublimet mystery. The controversy
there relates to the Mosaic observances, to which the false
Apostles were strenuously attempting to subject the Christians.
But as in the Epistle to the Galatians he goes to the depth of
that controversy, and reduces it to its source, so also in this
place. Foris in the rites you contemplate nothing but the
necessity of performing them, to what purpose were they
called a “ hand-writing that was against us ”l and almost the
whole os our redemption made to consist in its being “ blotted
out l ’' Wherefore it is evidont, that here is something to be
considered beside the external ceremonies. And 1 am per·
suaded that 1 have discovered the genuine meaning, at least if
that be conceded to meas a truth, which Augustine somewhere
very tmly assertS, and which he has even borrowcd from the
positive expressions of an Apostle, (e) that in thc Jewish cerc-
monies there was rather a confession of sins than an expiation
of thern. For what did they do in offering sacrifices, but
confess themselves worthy of death, since they substituted
victims to be slain in their stead? What were their purifica·
tione, but confessions that they were themselves impure?
Thus the hand-writing both os their sin and of their impurity
was frequently renewed by them; but that confession afforded
no deliverance. For which reason tho Apostle says that the
death of Christ affected “ the redemption of the transgressions
that were under the first testament.'’ (s ) The Apostle, there-
fore, justly denominatas the ceremonias “ a hand-writing against
those who observe thern ; '⁵ because by them they publicly at·
te'sted their condemnation and impurity. Nor does any ob-
jection arise from their having been also partakers of the same
grace with us. For this they obtained in Christ, not in the
ceremonias, which the Apostle there distinguishes from Christ;
for being practised at that time after the introduction os the
gospel, they obscured the glory of Christ. We find, then,
that the ceremonias, considered by themselveS, are beautifully
arrd appositely called a “hand-writing that was against ⁷’ the
salvation of men; because they were solemn instrumente tes-
tifying their guilt. When the false Apostles wished to bring
the Church back to the observance of thern, the Apostle deeply
investigated their signification, and very justly admonished the
Colossians into what circiunstances they would relapse, ifthey
should suffer themselves to be thus enslaved by thern. For
they would at the same time be deprived of the benefit of
Christ ; since, by the eternal expiation that he has once effected,
he has abolished those daily observances, which could only
attest their sins, bnt. could never cancel thern.
