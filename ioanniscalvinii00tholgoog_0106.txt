ought not to think that the Godhoad is like unto gold, or silver,
or stone, graven by art aud man's deviee.'’ (g) Whence it fol-
lows, that whatever statues are erected, or images painted, to
represent God, they are only displeasing to him, as being so
many insults to the Divrne Majesty. And why should we won-
derat the Holy Spirit thrmdering forth such oracles from heav-
en, siuce he compels the blind aud wretched idolaters to make
a similar confession on earth? Well known is the complaint of
Seneca, which is cited by Augustino: “ 'l'hey dedicate (says
he) the vilest and meauest materiale to represent the sacred, irn-
mortal, and inviolable gods; aud give them some a human
form, and some a brutal one, and some a double sex, and dif-
fereut bodies; and they confer th'e name of gods upon images
which, if animated, would be accounted monsters.'’ Hence it
· further appears that the pretence set up hythe advocates for
idols, that they were forbidden to the Jews because they were
prone to superstition, is only a frivolous cavil, to evade the
force of the argument. As if truly that were peculiarly applica-
ble to one nation, which God deduces from his eternal existence,
and the invariable order of nature! Besides, Paul was not ad-
dressing thc Jews, but the Atheniens, when he refuted the
error of making any similitude of God.

111. Sometimes indeed God hath discovered his presence by
certain signs, so that he was said to be seen “ face to face ; '’ (lt)
but all the signs which he ever adopted, were well calcula·
ted sor the instruction of men, and afforded clear intimatione of
his incomprehensible esseme. For “ the cloud, and the smoke,
and tho flame,’' (i) though thoy were symbols of celestial glory,
nevertheless operated as a restraint on the minds of all, to pre·
vent their attempting to penetrate any further. Wherefore even
Moses(to whom he manifested himself more familiarly than to
any other) obtained not by his prayers a sight of the face of God,
but received this answer: “ Thou canst not see my face; for
there shall no man see my face and live.’' (lc) The Holy Spirit
once appeared in the formos a dove ; (l) but, as he presently dis-
appeared again, who does not perceive that by this momentary
symbol the faithful are taught that they should believe the Spirit
to be invisible? that, being content with his power and grace,
they might make no external representation of him. The appear·
ances of God in the human form were preludes to his future
manifestation in Christ. Thereforo the Jews were not per·
mitted to make this a preterit for erecting a symbol of Deity in
the figure of a man. “ 'l'he mercy seat '² (m) also, from which,
tmder the lav, God displayed the presence of his power, was
so constructed, as to suggest that the best contemplation of the
