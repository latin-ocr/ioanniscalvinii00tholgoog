now meditating my own individual dafenes, in order to effect
a sese return to my native country; for, though 1100] tha as·
fection which every man ought to feel sor it, yet, under the
existing circumstances, Iregret not my removal from ic But
lplead the cause of all the godly, and consequendy ot' Glrrist
himself, which, having been in these times persecuted and
trampled on in sll ways in your kingdom, now lies in a mort
deplorable statc; and this indeed rather through the tyranny
