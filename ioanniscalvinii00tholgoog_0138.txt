men, so that it not only exerts its power in the elect, who ars

111. But, as l have hitherto only recited such things as ara
delivered without any obscurity or ambiguity in the Scripturas,
let persons who hesitate not to brand with ignominy those
oracles of heaven, beware what kind of opposition they make.
For, if they pretend ignorante, with a desire to be commended
for their modesty‚ what greater instance of pride can be con·
ceived, than to oppose one little word to the authority of God!
as, “lt appears otherwise to me,’' or, “l would rather not
meddle with this subject.'’ But if they openly censure, what
will they gain by their puny attempts against heaven? Their
petulance, indeed, is no novelty; for in all ages there have been
impious and profane men, who have virulently opposed this
doctrine. But they shall feel the truth of what the Spirit
long ago declared by the mouth of David, that God “is clear
when he judgeth.'' (y) David obliquely hints st the madness
of men who display such excessive presumption amidst their
insignificance, as not only to dispute against God, but to arro·
gate to themselves the power of condemning him. ln the
meantime, he briefly suggests, that God is unaffected by all
the blasphemies which they discharge against heaven, but that
he dissipates the mists of calumny‚ and illustriously displays
his righteousness; our faith, also, being founded on the Divina
word, (z) and therefore, superior to all the world, sronr its exalta-
tion looks down with contempt upon those rnists. F'or their
first objection, that, is nothing happens but by the will of God,
he has in him two contrary wills‚ because he decrees in his ι
secret counsel what he has publicly prohibited in his law, is
easily refuted. But before l reply, l wish the reader again to
be apprized, that this eavil is directed, not against me, but
against the Holy Spirit, who dictatod to the pious Job this
confession, that what had befallen him had happened accord·
ing to the Divine will: when he had been plundered by ban·
ditti, he acknowledged in their injuries the righteous scourge
of God. (a) What says the Scriptura in another case?
“ They,” the sons of Eli, “ heerkened not unto the voice of
their father, because the Lord would slay them.’'(b) The
Psalmist also exclaims, that “God” who “is in the hearers,
hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.'' (c) And now 1 have
sufficiently proved, that God is called the author of all those
things, which, according to the system of these censore, hap-
pen only by his uninfluential permission. He declares that he
