from any inanimata matter. Ar the same time he insists
equally ou another point-that it is presumption and madness
in mortal meu, who are every moment in danger of losing tho
flecting breath which they draw, to dare to confer upon idola
the honour due to God. Man is constrained to confess that
he is a creature of a day, and yet he will have a piecc of mctel
to bc worshipped as a god, of the deity of which he is the au·
thor; for whence did idols originatc, but in the willof men?
There is much propriety in tlrat sarcasm of a heathen poet,
who represents one of their idols as saying, “ Formerly, l was
the trunk of a wild fig-tree, a useless log; when the artificer,
after hesitating whether he would make me a stool or a deity,
at length determined that Ι should bc a god.'' (p)

A poor mortal, forsooth, who is, as it were, expiring almost
every moment, will, by his workmunship, transfer to a dead
stock the name and honour of God. But as that Epicurean, in
his satirical effusions, has paid no respect to any religion, — leav-
ing this sarcasm, and others of the same kind, wc should be
stung and penetrated by the rebuke which the Prophct (q) has
given to the extreme stupidity of those, who, with the samo
wood, make a fire to warm themselves, beat an oven for baking
breed, roast or boil their meat, and fabricate a god, before which
they prostrate themselves, to address their humble supplicatione.
ln another place, therefore, he not only pronounces them trans-
gressors of the law, but reproaches them for not having learned
from the foundations of the earth; (r) since, in reality, there is
nothing more uureasonable than the thought of contracting the
infinite and incomprehensible God within the compass of five
eet. And yet this monstrous abomination, which is monifestly
repugnant to the order of nature, experience demonstratas to ba
natural to man. It must be further observed, that idols are fre·
quently stigrnatized as being the works of men’s hands, unsanc·
tioned by Divine authority3 in order to establish this principle,
that all modes of worship which are merely of hrunan invention,
are detestable. The Psalmist aggravatas this madness, foras·
much as men implore the aid of dead and insensiblc things, who
are imbued with understanding to lrnow that all things aro
directed solely by the power of God. But since tha corrup-
tion of nature carries all natione in general, and each individua}
in particular, to such an excess of fremy, the Spirit at length
thunders out this direful irnprocation: “Let those that make
them be like unto them and every one that trustcth in them.'' (a)
Let ir be observed, that all similitudesare equally as much for·
bidden as graven images; which refutes the foolish subterfuge
of the Greeks; for they think themselves quito· sale, if they
