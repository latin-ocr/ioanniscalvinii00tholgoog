when it has prescribed any thing to be performed by us, it
teaches that the power of obedience proceeds from the good·
nass of God, and therefore invites us to pray that it may be
given us. If there were only a commandment, and no pro-
mise, there would be a trial of the sufficiency of our strength to
obey the commandment3 but since the commands are con·
nected with promises, which declara that we must darive not
only subsidiary power, but our whole strength, from the assist-
ance of Divina grace, they furnish abundant evidence that we
are not only unequal to the observation of the law, but alto·
gether incapable of it. Wherefore let them no more urge the
proportiones our ability to the precepts of the law, as though
the Lord had regulated the standard of righteousnem, which
he designed to give in the law, according to the measure of our
imbecility. lt should rather be concluded from the promises,
how unprepared we are of ourselves, since we stand in such
universal need os his grace. But will it, say they, be credited
by any, that the Lord addressed his law to stocks and stonesl
1 reply, that no one will attempt to inculcate sucha notion.
For neither are the impious stocks or stones, when they ara
taught by the law the contrariety of their dispositione to God,
and are convicted of guilt by the testimony of their own minds3
nor the picus, when, admonished of their own impotence, they
have recourse to the grace of God. Το this purpose are
the following passages from Augustine: “ God gives com·
mands which we cannot persona, that we may know what
we ought to request of him. The utility of the precepts is
great, if only so much be given to free will, that the grace of
God may receive the greater honour. Faith obtains what the
law commands3 and the law therefore commands‚ that saith
may obtain that which is commanded by the law: moreover
God requires faith itself of us, and finds not what he requires,
unless he has given what he finds.’' Again: ‘⁴ Let God give
what he enjoins, and let him enjoin what he pleascs‚''

VIII. This will more clearly appear in an examination of
the three kinds of precepts which we bave already mentioned.
The Lora, both in the law and in the prophets, frequently
commands us to be converted to him 3 (z) but the Prophet, on
the other hand, says, “ Turn thou me, and l shall be turned.”
“After that I was turned, 1 repented,” doc. (a) He commands
us to circumcise our hearts; but he announces by Moses, that
this circumcisionis the work of his own handlb) He fre-
quently requires newness of heart3 but elsewhere declares that
this is his own gift. (c) “What God promises,” Augustino says,
“ we do not perform ourselves through free will or nature3 but
