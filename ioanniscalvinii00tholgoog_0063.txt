to please him. For, embracing only those things which he
declares he disrcgards‚ it either contemptuously practises, or
even openly rejects, what he prescribes and declares to be
pleasiug in his sight. Persons who introduce newly·invented

methodo os worshippiug God, really worship and adore the

· creature os their distempered imaginatious3 t‘or they would

never have dared to trifle in such a manner with God, is they
had not first seigned a god conformable to their own salse and
soolish notione. Wheresore the apostle pronounces s vague
aud unsettled notion conseming the Deity to be ignorance oi
God. “ When ys knew not God, (says he,) ye did service unto
theru which by nature were no gods’'(q) And in another
place he speaks os the Ephesians as having been “without
God,’' (r) while they were strangers to a right knowledge of
the only true God. Nor, in this respect, is it os much im·
portance, whether you imagine to yourself one god or more,
t‘or iu either case you depart and revolt from the true God, aud,
t'orsakiug him, you have nothing lest you but au execrable
idol. We must therefore decide, with Lactantius, that there
is uo legitimare religion unoonnected with truth.

' IV. Another sin is, that they never think os God but against
their inclinatione, nor approach him till thcir reluctauce is over·
cotue by constraint; and then they are induenced, not by a
voluntary sear, proceeding from revereuce os the Divine lda-
jesty, but by aservile and coustrained sear, extorted by the
divine judgment, which they dread because it is inevitable, st
the same time that they hate it. Now, to impiety, aud to thls
speciosos it alone, is applicable that assertion os Statius, that
soar first mede gods in the world. (s) They, whose minds are
alienated from the righteousuess os God,-eamestly desire the
subversion ol that tribunal, which they know to be established
sor the punishment os transgressions against it. With this
disposition, they wege wer against the lord, who cannot be
deprived oi his judgment3 but when they appreheud his irre·
sistible arm to bo impending over their heads, unable to avert
or evade it, they tremble with sear. That they may not seem
altogether to despise him, whose majesty troubles them, they
praetise some sorm os religion; et the same time not ceasiug
to pollute themselves with vices os every kind, aud to add one
flagitious act to another, till they have violated every part oi
God’s holy law, and dissipated all its righteousuess. It is
certain, at least, that they are not presented by that pretended
sear os God srom enjoying pleasure and satisfaction in their
sius, practisiug sels-adulation‚ and preferring the indulgence of
their own carnal intemperanee to the salutary restraints oi the
