argeus to confess that it is schimatieal in stirring up opposi-
tion against the chureh, or that the Ohurch was wholly extinet
lor meny ages, during which no such thing was known.-
Lestly, they say all arguments are unneceseary; sor that ita
nature may be determined by its snrits, since it has produced
such a multitude ol seete, so many sectious tumults, end such
great licentiousness or* vices lt is indeed very easy r'or them
to insulta deserted cause with the creduloua and ignorant mul·
titude; but, ifwe had also the liberty os speaking in our turn,
this acrimony, which they now discover in violently foeming
against us with aquai licentiousness and impunity, would pres-
ently eool.

ln the first place, their calling it novel is highly injurious to
God, whose holy word deserves not to be eecused of novelty.
1 have no doubt ol its being new to them, to whom Jesus
Christ and the Gospel are equally new. But those who know
the antiquity ol this preaching os Paul, “ that Jesus Christ died

no novelty among us. That it has long been concealed‚ buried,
end unknown, is the crime os human impiety. Now that the
goodness of God has restored it to us, it ought at least to be
allowed its just claim of antiquity.

From the seme source os ignoranee springs the notion ol its
being doubtful and uncertain. This is the very thing which
the Lord complains of by his prophet3 that “the ox knoweth
hie owner, and the ass his master’s erib,” (i) but that his people
know not him. But however they may laugh at its uncer-
tainty, if they were called to seal their own doctrine with
their blood and lives, it would appear how much they value it.
Very different is our confidenee, which dreeds neither the ter·
rors of death, nor even the tribunal os God.

Their requiring miracles of usis altogether unreasonab103
sor we forge no new Gospel, but retain the very same whose
truth was confirmed by all the miracles ever wrought by Christ
and the apostles. But they have this peculiar advantage above
us, that they ean confirm their saith by continual miracles even
to this day. But the truth is, they allege miracles which are
calculated to unsettle a mind otherwise well established, they
