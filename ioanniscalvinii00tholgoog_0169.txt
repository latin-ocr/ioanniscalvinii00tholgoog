Epistle to the Romans be declares that “it is not of him that
willctb, nor of him that ruuuetb, but of God that showeth
morey τ ” (q) yet afterwards he refrains not from the use of
admonition, exhortation, aud reproof. Why do they not, there·
fore, remonstrate with the Lord, not to lose his labour in such
amanuer, by requiring of men those things which hc alone
cau bestow, and punishiug those things which are committed
for wantos his grace? Why do they not admouisb Paul to
spere those who are unable to will or run without tbe previous
mercy of God, of which they are now destitute? As though
truly tbc Lord has not the best reason for his doctrine, which
readily presents itsclf to those who religiously scel< it. Paul
clearly shows how far doctrine, exhortation, and reproof, can
of themselves avail towards producing a change of beart, when
he says that “neither is be that planteth any thing, neither he
that watereth; but” that the efficacy is solely from “ God
that givetb the increase.” (r) Thus wc see that Moses severely
sanctiens tbe precepts of the law, and the Prophets earnestly
urge and threaten transgressors; whilst, nevertheless, they ac·
knowledge, tbat meu never begin to be wise till a beart is
given theru to understand 3 that it is the peculiar work of God
to circumcise tbe beart, aud instead of a stony beart to give a
heart of flesb3 to inscribe his law iu men’s minds; in a word,
to render his doctrine effectual by a renovation of tbe seul.

V. What, then, it will be inquired, is the use of exhortations?
l reply, If the impious despise them with obstinate hearts,
they will serve for a testimony against them, when they sball
come to tbe tribunal of the Lord; anderen in tha present
state they wound their consciences ; for however the most
audacious person may deride thern, be cannot disapprove of
them in his beart. But it will be said, What can amiserable
sinuer do, if the softness of heart, which is necessary to obe-
dience, be denied him? l ask, What excuse can he plead,
seeing that be cannot imputa the barduess of his beart to any
oue but himself? 'Phe impious, therefore, who are ready, if
possible, to ridicule the Divine precepts and exhortatious, are,
iu spite of their own inclinations, confouuded by their power.
But tbc principal utility should be considered in regard to the
faithful, in whom as the Lord performs all things by bis Spirit,
so he neglects not the instrumentality of his word, but uses it
with great efficacy. Let it be allowed, then, as it ought to be,
that all tbe strength of the pious consists in tbe grace of God,
according to this expressiones the Prophct: “I will give them
anew beart, that they may walk in my statutes.” (a) But you
will object, Why are they admonished of their duty, aud not
