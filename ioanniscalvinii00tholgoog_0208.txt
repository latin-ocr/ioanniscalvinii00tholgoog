sary for the Church of God to ascend from those rudiments to
sublimet heights, is explained by John the Baptist: “the law
was given by Moses, but grace and truth carne by Jesus
Christ.” (l) For although expiatron of sin was truly pro·
mised in the ancient sacrifices, and the ark of the covenant
was a certain pledge of the paternal favour of God, all these
would have been mere shadows, if they had not been founded
in the grace of Christ, where alone we may find true and eter-
nal stability. let us firmly maintain, then, that though the
legal rites have ceased to be observed, yet their very discon-
tinuance gives us a better knowledge os their great utility
before the advent of Christ, who, abolishing the observance of
them, confirmed their virtue and efficacy in his death.

XVII. The reesouing of Paul is attended with more diffi-
culty: “And you, being dead in your sins, and the uncircum·
cision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him,
having forgiven you all trespasses3 blotting out the hand-
writing of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary
to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his crosS‚’' doc. (c)
For it seems to extend the abolition of the law somewhat
further, as though we had now no 'concern with its “ordi-
nances.'’ Por they are in au error who understand it simply
of the moral law, the abolition of which they, nevcrtheless,
explain to relate tc its inexorable severity, rather than to its
precepts. Others, more acutely and carefully considering the .
words of Paul, perceive that they belong particularly to the
ceremonial law3 and prove that the word “ ordinances’' is
more than once used by Paul in that signification. For he
thus expresses himself to the Ephesians: “ He is our peace,
who hath made both one3 having abolished the law of com·
mandments contained in ordinances3 sor tc make in himself
of twain one new man.’' (cl) That he there speaks of the
ceremonieS, is very evident3 for he calls the law “the middle
wall os partition,'’ by which the Jews were separated from tha
Gentiles. Wherefore l allow that the former commentatore
are justly censured by these ; but even these do not appear to
me clearly to explain the meaning of the Apostle. For to
compare these two passages as in all respecta similar, is what
Iby no means approve. When he designs to assure the
Ephesians of their admission into fellowship with the Israel·
ites‚ he informs them, that the impedimeut which formerly
prevented it is now removed. That consisted in ceremo-
nies. Por the rites of ablutions and sacrifices, by which the
Jews were consecrated to the Lord, caused a separation be-
tween thern and the Gentiles. But in the Epistle to the Go-
