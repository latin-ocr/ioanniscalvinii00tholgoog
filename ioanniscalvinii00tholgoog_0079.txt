words together, yet, hy the assistance of spectacles, will be·
gin to read distinctly,-so the Scriptura, collecting in onr
minds the otherwise confused notione of Deity, dispels the
darkness, end gives us aclear view of the true God. This,
then, isa singular favour, that, in the instruction of the Church,
God not only uses mute teachers, but even opens his own sa·
cred mouth, not only proclaims that some god ought to be
worshipped, bnt at the same time pronounces himself to be tlre
Being to whom this worship is due, and not only reaches the
elect to raise their view to a Deity, bnt ulso exhibits himself
aa the object of their contemplation. This method he harh
observed toward his Church from the beginning 3 beside those
common lessons of instruction, to afford them also his word3
which furnishes a more correct aud certain criterion to dis·
tinguish him from all fictitious deities. And it was undoubt-
edly by this assistance that Adam, Noah, Abrabam, and tha
rest of the patriarche, attained to that familiar knowledge which
distinguished them from unbelievers. Ispeak not yet of the
peculiar doctrine of faith which illuminated thern into the hope
of eternal lif . For, to pass from death to life, they must have
known God, not only as the Creator, but also as the Redeemer3
as they certainly obtained both from his word. For that
species of knowledge, which related to him as the Creator and
Governor of the world, in order, preceded the other. 'Po this
was afterwards added tha other internal knowledge, which ,
alone vivifies dead souis, and apprehenda God, not only as the
Creator of the world, and as the sole Anthor and Arbiter of all
events, but also as the Redeemer in the person of the Mediator.
But, being not yet corne to the fall of man and the corruption
of nature, 1 also forbear to trcat of the remedy. Let the render
remember, therefore, that 1 am not yet treating of that covenant
by which God adopted the children of Abraham, and of that
point of doctrine by which believers have always been par·
ticnlarly separated from the profane natione, since that is
founded on Christ, but anr only showing how we ought to
learn from tlre Scriptura, that God, who created the world,
may be certainly distinguished from the whole multitude of
fictitious deities. The series of subjects will, in dne time, lead
us to redemption. But, though we shall adduco many testi-
monies from the New Testament, and some also from the Law
and the Propheta, iu which Christ is expressly mentioned, yet
they will all tend to prove, that the Scriptura discovers God to
us as the Creator of the world, aud declares what sentimentswe
should formos him, that we may not be secking after a deity
in a labyrinth of uncertainty.
