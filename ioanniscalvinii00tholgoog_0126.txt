began inveterately to hate and execrata the name hadom, (con-
substantial.) But is, in the first instance, they had sincerely
and cordially confessed Gbnst to be God, they would not have
denied him ιο be consubstantial with the Father. Who can
dare to censure those good men, ss quarrelsome and conten·
tious, sor having kindled such a flarne of controversy, and dis·
turbed the peace of the Ohurch on account of one little word?
That little word distinguished Olrristians, who held the pure
saith, from sacrilegious Arians. Asterwards arose Sabellius,
who considered the names of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
ss little more than empty sounds; arguing, that they were
not used on account os any real distinction, but were different
attributes os God, whose attributes of this kind are numerous.
If the point carne to be controverted, he confessed, that he
believed the Father to be God, the Son God, and the Holy
Spirit God ; but he would readily evade all the force of this
confession, by adding, that he had said no other than if he
had called God potent, and just, and wise. And thus he came
ιο another conclusion, that the Fatber is the Son, and that the
Holy Spirit is the Father, without any order or distinction.
The good doctors os that age, who had the interest os religion
at heart, in order to counteract the wickedness os this man,
maintained, on the contrary, that they ought really to ac·
knowledge three peculiar properties in one God. And, to
defend themselves against his intricate subtleties, by the plain
and simple truth, they affirmed, that they truly subsisted in
the onc God; or, what is the sarno, that in the unity os God
there subsisted a trinity of Persons.

V. Is, then, the words have not been rashly invented, we
should beware lest we be convicted os fastidious temerity in
rejecting them. 1 could wish them, indeed, to be buried in
oblivion, provided this saith were universally received, that
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, ate the one God; arrd that
nevertheless the Son is not the Father, nor the Spirit the Son,
but that they are distinguished from each other by some pe·
culiar property. 1 am not so rigidly precise as to be fond of
contending sor mere words. For 1 observa that the ancients,
who otherwise speak on these subjects with great piety, are
not consistent with each other, nor, in all cases, with themselves.
For what sorms os expression, adopted by councils, does
Hilary excuse! To what extremes does Augustino sorne-
times proceed! How different are the Greeks stom the
Latios! But ol this variation, let one example suffice : when
the Latins would translate the word ὁμωύσιος, they called it
consubstantiat, siguisying the substance of the Father and the
Son ιο be one, and thus using substance for essenos. Whence
also Jerome, writing to Damasus, pronounces it to be sacrilege
