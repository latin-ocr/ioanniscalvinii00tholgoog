We dill'er from one another, iu that each individual imbibas
soma peculiarity of error; but we perfectly agree in a univer*
sal depmture from the one true God, to preposterous trifles.
This disease affecta, not only the vulgar and ignorant, but the
most eminent, and those who, in other things, discover peculiar
sagacity. How abundantly have all the philosophare, in this
respect, betrayed their stupidity and folly! For, to spara others,
chargeable with greater absurdities, Plato himself, the most ra·
ligious and judicious of them all, loses himself in his round
globe. (r r) And what would not befall others, when their prin·
cipal mon, whose place rt was to enlighten the rest,stu1nble
upon such gross errors! So also, while the govemment of
human actions proves a providence too plainly to admit of a
denial, men darive no more advantage from rt, than if they bo-

the uncertain caprice of fortune; so great is our propensity to

even that almost every individual had his own particular deity.
For, amidst the union os temerity and wantonness with igno·
rauce and darkness, scarcely a man could be found who did
not frama to himself some idol or phantasm instead of God.
Iudeed, the immense multitude of gods proceeding from the
mind of man, resembles the ebullition of waters from a vast
and ample spring, while every oue, with an extreme licentious·
ness of error, invents one thing or another concerning uod
himself. lt is not necessary here to composa a catalogue os
the superstitious which have perplexed the world ; sor it would
be an andless task3 and, without a word more being said, tha

such a multiplicity of corruptions. 1 pass over the rude aud
