guish him by the same epitheta, when they intend a complete
exhibition of his holy name. But, to avoid the necessity of
quoting many passages, let us content ourselves at present
with referring to one Palm, (z) which contains such an ac·
curate summary of all his perfectione, that nothing seems to
be omitted. And yet it contains nothing but what may be
known from a contemplation of the creaturos. Thus, by the
teaching os experience, we perceive God to be just what he
declares himself in his word. ln Jeremiah, where he an·
nounces in what characters he will be known by us, he gives
a description, not so full, but to the same effect- “ Let him
that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth
me, that 1 am the Lord, which exercise lovingkindness, judg-
ment, and righteousness in the earth.'’ (a) These three things
it is certainly of the highest importance for us to know-
mcrcy, in which alone consists all our salvation; judgment,
, which is executed on the wicked every day, and awaits thern
in a still heavier degree to eternal destruction ; righteousness,
by which the faithful are preserved, and most gracionsly sup·
posted. When you understand these things, the prophecy de·
clares that you have abundant reason for glorying in God.
Nor is this representation chargeable withan omission of his
truth, or his power, or his holiness, or his goodness. For how
could we have that knowledge, which is here required, of his
righteousness, mercy, and judgment, unless it were supported
by his inflexible veracityl And how could we believe that
he governed the world in judgment and justice, if we were

and righteousness, holiness also niust lie conspicdously dis1
played in them. Moreover, the knowledge of God, which is
afforded usin the Scripturas, is designed for tho same end as
that which we derive from the creatures: it invites us first to
the fear of God, and then to conlidence iu him; that we may
leam to honour him with perfect innocence of life, and sincere
obedience to his will, and to place all our dependence on his
goodness.

cral doctrine. And, first, let the reader observe, that the
Scripture, in order to direct ns to the truc God, expressly cx·
eludes and rejects all the gods of the heathen3 because, in
almost all ages, religion has been generally corrupted. lt is
true, indeed, that the name of one supreme God has been
universally known and celebrated. For those who used to
worship a multitude of deities, whenever they spake according
