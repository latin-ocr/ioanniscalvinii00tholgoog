owe him universal obedionce. He who neglecta this distinction
will have nothing decided in religion3 since those holy men
were ignorant of many things, frequently at variance with
each other, aud sometimes even inconsistent with themselves.
There is great reason, they say, for the admonitiones Solomou,
“not to transgress or remove the ancient landmarks, which our
fathers have set.'' (to) But the same rule is not applicable to
the bonnding of fields, and to the obedience of saith, which
ought to be ready to “forget her own people and her father’a
house.'’ (n) But if they are so fond of allegorizing, why do
they not explain the apostles, rather than any others, to be
those fathers, whose appointed landmarks it is so unlawful to
remove? For this is the interpretation of Jerome, whose work·
they have received into their canons. But if they insist on
preserving the landmarlrs of those whom they understand to bs

that our God neither ests nor drinlrs, and therefore noeds nei·

gold, and that gold is no recommendation of that which is not
purchased with gold. This landmark therefore is transgressed
by those who in sacred things are so much delighted with gold,
silver, ivory, marble, jewels, aud silks, and suppose that God
is not rightly worshipped, unless all things abound in exqui·

level with a cheat or a robber; and the other, that it is unlaw·
ful for monks to live on what is not their own, notwithstanding
their assiduity in contemplatione, studies, and prayers3 and
they have transgressed this landmark by placing the idle and
distended carcasses of monlrs in cells and brothels, to be pam·
