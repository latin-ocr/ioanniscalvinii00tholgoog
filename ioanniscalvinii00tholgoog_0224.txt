even the smellest portion from his glory, he must be left -iu
possession of all that belongs to him. The following clause,
“before me,'’ aggravates the atrociousness of the offense, for
God is provoked to jealousy whenever we substitute the fig·
ments of our own minds instead of him, just us an immodest
woman, by openly introducing au adulterer into the presence
of her husband, would inflante his mind with the greater re·
sentment. When God, therefore, by the presence of his power
and grace, gave a proof of his regard to the people whom he
had chosen, - in order the more forcibly to deter them from the
crime of rebellion against him, he warns them of the impossi-
bility of introducing new deities without his beinga witness
and spectator of the sacrilege. For this presumption rises to
the highest degree of impiety, when man imagines that he cun

elude the observation of God in his acts of rebellion. God, ou ’

the contrary, proclaims, that whatever we devise, whatever we
attempt, whatever we perform, is present to his view. Our
conscience must therefore be pure even from the most latent
thoughts of apostasy, if we wish our religion to obtain the ap·
probation of the Lord. For he requires from us the glory due
to his Divinity undiminished and uncorrupted, not only in ex·
ternal confession, but in his own eyes, which penetrate the
inmost recesses of our hearts.

XVII. As in the preceding commandment the Lord has
declared himself to be the one God, besides whom no other
deities ought to be imagined or worshipped, so in this he more
clearly reveals his nature, and the kind of worship with which
he ought to be honoured, that we may not dare to form any
carnal conceptione of him. 'Phe end, therefore, of this precept
is, that he will not have his legitimate worship profaned with
superstitious rites. Wherefore, iu aword, lie cellsus off, and
wholly abstracte us from carnal observances, which our foolish
minds are accustomed to devise, when they conceive of God
according to the grossness os their own apprehensione, and
therefore he calls us‘to the service which rightfully belongs to
him3 thetis, the spiritual worship which he has instituted.
He marks what is the grossest transgression of this lrind; that is,
external idolatry. And this precept consists of two parts. 'Phe
first restrains us from licentiously daring to make God, who is
