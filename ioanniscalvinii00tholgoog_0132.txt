whereby the Branch of David shall be called “Jehovah our
righteousness.'' (w) For since 1110 Jews themselves teach, that all
other names of God are mere epithets, but that this 010110, which
they call ineffable, is a proper name expressive of his Essence,
we conclude, 11101 the Son is the one eternal God, who declares,
in another place, that he “ will not give his glory to another.’' (a)
This also they endeavour 10 evade, because Moses imposed
this name on an 01101 which he built, and Ezekiel 011 the city
of the new Jerusalem. But who does not perceive, that the
altar was erected as a monument of Moses having been exalted
by God, and that Jerusalem 10 honoured with the name 01 God,
only as 0 testimony of the Diviue presence? For thus speaks
the prophet: “The name cfr-the city shall be, Jehovah is
there.’' (y) But Moses expresses himself thus: He “built au
altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi,'’ (1110010110-
tion.)(z) Β11111101010111010 contentiori about another passage
01 Jeremiah, where the same title is given 10 Jerusalem in these
words: “This is the name wherewith she shall be called, Je-
hovah our righteousness.’' (a) But this testimony is sofar
110111 opposing the truth which we are defending, that 11 rather
confirma it. For, having before testified that Christ is the true
Jehovah, from whom righteousness proceeds, he now pro-
nounces that the church will have such a clear apprehension 01 ν
11, 00 10 110 ableto glory in the same name. ln the former
place, then, is shown the original cause of righteousnesS, 111 the
latter the effect.

X. Now, if these things do not satisfy the Jews, 1000 1101 by
what cavils they ean evade the accounts 01 ‘Jehovah having so
frequently appeared in the character of an angel. An angel is
said 10 have appeared 10 the holy fathers. He claims 101 111111·

⁴ sels the name 01 the eternal God. 11 it be objectcd, that this is

spoken with regard to the character which he sustains, this by
110 11100110 removes the difficulty. For a servant would never
rob God 01 his honour, by permitting sacrifice 10 be offered to
himself. But 1110 angel, refusing to eat bread, commands a
sacrifice to be offered 10 Jehovah. He afterwards demonstrates
that he is really Jehovah himself. Therefore Manoah and his
wife conclude, 110111 this evidence, that they have seen, not a
mere angel, but God himself. Hence he says, “ We shall surely
die, because we have seen God.” When his wife replies, “If
1110 Lord were pleased 10 kill us, he would not have received ’³ ,
0 sacrifice “ at our hands‚” (11) she clearly acknowledges him 10
be God, who before is called an angel. Moreover, the reply 01 the
angel himself removes every doubt : “Why askest thou after
my name, seeing it is wonderful? ” So much the more detes-
