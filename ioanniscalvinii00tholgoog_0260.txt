den desire of transferring its happiness from God to some other
being 3 whence proceed these emotions, however transient, but
from the existence of some vacant space in the soul to receive
such temptations? And not to protract this argument to greater
length, we are commanded to love God with all our beart,
with all our mind, and with all our soul: therefore, unless all
the powers of our soul be intensely engaged iu the love of
God, we have already departed from the obedience required by
the law 3 for that the dominion of God is not well established

in our conscience, is evident, from the enemies that there rebel =

against his government‚ aud interrupt the execution of his
commands. That the last commandment properly belongs to
this point, has been already demonstrated. Have we felt any
evil desire in our heart? we are already guilty of concupis·
cence, and are become at once transgressors of the law; be·
cause the Lord forbids us, not only to plan aud attempt any
thing that would prove detrimental to another, but even to be
stimulated and agitated with concupiscence. Now, the curse
os God always rests on the transgression of the law. We have
no reason, therefore, to exempt even the most trivial emotions
of concupiscence from the sentence of death. ,“ In determining
the nature of different sins,’' says Augustine, “let us not use
deceitful balancss, to weigh what we please and how we

-This is light ; but let us borrow the Divine balance from
the Holy Scriptures, as from the treasury of the Lord, and
therein weigh what is heavy3 or rather let us weigh nothing
ourselves, but acknowledge the weights already determined by
the Lord.'’ And what says the Scripture? The assertion of
Paul, that “the wages of sin is death,'' (i) sufficiently demon·
strates this groundless distinction to have been unknown to
him. As we have already too strong a propensity to hypocrisy,
this opiate ought by no means to have been added, to lull our
consciences into greater insensibility.

LIX. Iwish these persons would consider the meaning of
this declaration of Christ: “Whosoever shall break one of
these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be
called the least in the kingdom of heaven.’' (lc) Are not they
of this number, who thus presume to extenuate the transgres-
sion of the law, as though it were not worthy of death? But
they ought to consider, not merely what is commanded, but
who it is that gives the commands; because the smallest trans·
gression of the law, which he has given, is a derogation from
his authority. Is the violation of the Divine majesty in any
case a trivial thing in their estimationi Lastly, if God has de·
