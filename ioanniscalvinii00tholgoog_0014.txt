But perhaps, of all the writiugs of Calvin, none has ex·
cited so much attention as his lnsmrures os rna Cunis-
‘nnn Remuron.

His original design in commencing this work is stated
by himself, in the beginning of his dedication, to have been

dress; the firm attachment to the Diviue word; the
Christian fortitude iu the midst of persecutiou; the trium·

qualities which distinguisb this celebrated remonstrance,
will surely permit no reader os taste or piety to wimnold
