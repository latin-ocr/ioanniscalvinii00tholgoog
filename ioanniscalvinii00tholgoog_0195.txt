them this end of their adoption, that they might “be unto
God a kingdom of priests ; '’ (n) which could not be attained
without a greater and more excellent reconciliation than could
arise srom the blood 01 beasts. For what is more improbable
than that the sons 01 Adam, who by hereditary contagion are
all born the slaves 01 sin, should be exalted to regal dignity,
and thus become partakers 01 the glory 01 God, unless such
an eminent blessing proceeded from some other source than
themselves? How also could the right of the priesthood re·
main among them, the pollution 01 whose crimes rendered
thern abominabis to God, unless they had been consecrated in
aholy head? Wherefore Peter makes a beautiful application
01 this observation ot' Moses, suggesting that the plenitude 01
that grace, 01 which the Jews enjoyed a taste under the law, is
exhibited in Christ. “ Ye are,'' says he, “a ehosen generatim,
aroyal priesthood.’' (0) This application 01 the words tends
to shotv, that they, to whom Christ has appeared under the
gospel, have obtained more than their forefathers3 because
they are all invested with sacerdotal and regal honours, that in
a dependence on their Mediator they may venture to come
boldly rnto the presence 01 God

ΙΙ And here it must be remarked, bytho way, that the
kingdom, which at length was erected m the family 01 David,

is a part 01 the lav, and comprised under the ministry 01 ,

Moses3 whence it follows, that both in the posterity 01 David,
and in the whole Levitical tribe, as in a twofold mittor, Christ
was exhibited to the view 01 his ancient people. For, as I
have just observed, it was otherwise impossible that in the
Divine view they should be kings and priests, who were tho
slaves of sin and death, and polluted by their own corruptions.
Hence appears the truth 01 the assertion 01 Paul, that the
Jews were subject, as it were, to the authority osa school·
master, till the advent of that seed, for whose sake the promise
was given. (p) For Christ being not yet familiarly discovered,
they were like children, whose imbecility could not yet bear
the full knowledge 01 heavenly things. But how they were
led to Christ by the ceremonias, has been already stated, and
may be better learned from the testimonies 01 the Prophets.
For although they were obliged every day to approach God
with new sacrifices, in order to appease him, yet Isaiah pro·
mises them the expiation 01 all their transgressions by a single
sacrifice, (q) which is confirmed by Daniel. (r) The priests
chosen srom the tribe 01 Levi, used to enter into the sanctuary;
