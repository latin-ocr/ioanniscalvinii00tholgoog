Catilina, or in Camillus we shall have an example that nature,
if it be studiously cultivated, is not altogether destitute of
gooduess. l grant, indeed, that the virtues displayed in Camil·
lus were gifts of God, and if considered in themselves, appear
justly worthy of commendation: but how will they be proofs
of any natural goodness in him? To establish this, must we
not recur to the heart, and argue, that if anatural man was
eminent for such integrity of manners, human nature is not
destitute of ability for the pursuit of virtue? But what if his
heart was depraved and perverted, and followed any thing
rather than the path of rectitude? And that it was such, if
you concede that he was a natural man, is beyond all doubt.
What ability, then, will you attribute to human nature for the
pursuit of virtue, if, with the greatest appearance of integrity,
itis discovered to be always tending to corruption? 'Phere-
fore, as you will not commend a man for virtue, whose vices
have only counterfeited the extemal form of virtue, so you
must not attribute to the human will a power of desiring‘what
is right, as long as it continues fixed in its perverseness. The
most certain and easy solution of this question, however, is,
that those virtues are not the common properties of nature, but
the peculiar graoes of God, which he dispenses in great variety,
and in a certain degree tomen that are otherwise profane.
For which reason we hesitate not, in common speech, to call
the nature of one man good, and 01 another depraved. Yet
we still include both in the universal state 01 human depravity3
but we signify what peculiar grace God has conforred on the
one, with which he has not deigned to favour the other.
When he determined to exalt Saul to the kingdom, he made
him, as it were, a new man; and this is the reason why Plato,
alluding to the fable of Homer, says, that the sons of kings
are formed with some distinguishing singularity os character;
because God, consultiug the benefit os mankind, frequently fur·
nishcs withan heroic nature those whom he destines to hold
the reins 01 empire; and from this source have proceeded all
the exploits of great heroes which are celebrated in history.
'rue same judgment must be formed conceming those also who
are in a private station. But because every onc who has risen
to great eminence has been impelled by his ambition, which
defiles all virtues, and deprives them 01 all excellence in the
Divine view, whatever may be apparently luudable in ungodly
men, ought not to be esteemed at all meritorious. Besides,
the chief branchos rectitude is wanting, where there is no
concern to display the glory of God: 01 this principle aliare
destitute whom he has not regenerated by his Spirit. Nor is

it in vain that Isaiah says, that “ the spirit of the fear of the
Lord shall rest upon ” Christ3 (a) which teaches us, that all
