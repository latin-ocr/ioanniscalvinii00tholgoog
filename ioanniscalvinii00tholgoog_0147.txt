that mansius less voluntarily, because he is under a necessity

of sinning? This necessity Augustine every where maintains;
and even when he was pressed with the cavils os Celestius,
who tried to throw an odium on this> doctrine, he conlidently
expressed himself in these terms: “By means os liberty it
came to pass that mansell into sin; but now the penal depra-
vity consequent on it, instead of liberty, has introduced necessi-
ty.'' And whenever the mention os this subject occurs, he
hesitates not to speak in this manner of the necessary servitude
of sin. We must·therefore observe this grand point of distino-

tion, that man, having been corrupted by his sall, sins volunta·
rily, not with reluctance or eoustraint3 with the strongest
propensity of disposition, not witlr violent coercion; with the
bias os his own passions, and not with external compulsion:

yet such is the pravity of his nature, that he cannot be exeited
and biassed to any thing but what is evil. lt thisbe true,

ι there is no impropriety in affirming, that he is under a necessi·

ty of sinning. Bemard, subscribing to what is said by Augus·
tine, thus expresses himself: “Among all the animals, man
alone is sree3 and yet, by the interventiones sin, he also suffers
aspecies of violence; but srom the will, not srom nature, so
that he is not thereby deprived of his innate liberty.'' For
what is voluntary is also free. And a little aster: “The will
being, by 1 know not what corrupt and surprising means,
changed sor the worse, is itsels the authores the necessity to
which it is subject; so that neither necessity, being voluntary,
ean excuse the will, nor tlre will, being fascinated‚ can exclude
necessity.’' For this necessity is in some measure voluntary.
Afterwards he says, that we are oppressed with a yoke, but no
other than that os a voluntary servitude; that therefore our
servitude renders us miserable, and our will renders us inexcu-
sable; because the will, when it was free, made itsels the slave
os sin. At length he concludes “Thus the soul, in a certain
strange and evil manner, under this kind of voluntary and free
yet pernicibus necessity, is both enslaved and sree; enslaved
by necessity, free by its will, and, what is more wonderful
and more miserable, it is guilty, because free ; and enslaved
wherein it is guilty; and so therein enslaved wherein it is
t‘ree.’' From these passages the render clearly pereeives thatl
am teaching no novel doctrine, but what was long ago advanccd
by Angustiae, with the universal consent os picus men, and
which for nearly a thousand years aster was confined to the
eloisters of monhs. But Lombard, sor wantos knowing how
to distinguish necessity from coaction, gave rise to a pernicious
error.

VI. It is necessary, on the other hand, to consider the remedy
of Divine grace, by which the depravity ol nature is corrected
