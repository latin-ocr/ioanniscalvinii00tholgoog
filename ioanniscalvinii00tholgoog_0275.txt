discriminatae the weakness of the law from the stability of the
gospel. Here it must also be remarked concaming the holy
fathers, that though they lived under the Old Testament, they
did not rest satisfied with it, but always aspired after the New,
and thus enjoyed a certain participation of it. For all those
who contented themselves with present shadows, aud did not
extend their news to Christ, are condemned by the apostle as
blind and under the curse. For, to say nothing on other points,
what greater ignorance can be imagined than to hope for an
expiation of sin by the sacrifice of an animali than to seek
for the purification of the soul by an external ablution with
water? than to wish to appease God with frigid ceremouies, as
though they aflorded him great pleasure? For all these absurdi·
ties are chargeeble on those who adhere to the observances of
the law, without any reference to Christ.

ΧΙ. The fifth difference‚ which we may add, consiste in
this-that till the advent of Christ, the Lord selected one
nation, to which he would lirnit the covenant of his grace.
Moses says, “When the Most High divided to the nations
their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, -tbe
Lord’s portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheri-

Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love thern, and he chose
their seed after thern, even you above all people.'' (l) There·
fore he favoured that people with the exclusive knowledge of
his name, as though they alone of all mankind belonged
to him; he deposited his covenant as it were iu their bosom; ,
to them he manifested the presence of his power; he honoured
them with every privilege. But to omit the rest of his benefits,
the only one that relates to our present argument is, that he
united thern to himself by the communication of his word, iu
order that he might be denominated and esteemed their God.
ln the mean time he suffered other nations, as though they had
no business or intercourse with him, to walk in vanity; (m)
nor did he employ means to prevent their destmction by send·
ing them the only remedy -the preacbing of his word. The
Israelitish nation, therefore, were then as derling sons; others
were strangers: they were known to him, aud received under
his faithful protection3 others were left to their own darkness:
they were sanctified by God; others were profane: they were
honoured with the Divina presence, others were excluded
from approaching it. But when the fulness of the time was
corne, (n) appointed for the restoration of all things, (o) and
