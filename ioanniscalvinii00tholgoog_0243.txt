XXXVIII. Moreover‚ when the Lord promises the blessing
of tho present life to those children who honour their parents
with proper reverence, he at the sarne tirne implica that a cer·
tain curse impends over all those who are disobedient and
perverse. And that it might not fail of being executed, he

lf they escape that, he puitshes them himself in some other
way. For we see what great numbers of persons of this cha·
racter fall in battlcs and in private quarrels; others are affiict-
edin unusual ways ; and almost all of them are prooss of the
trnth of this threatening. But if any arrive at an extreme age,
being deprived of the Divino blessing, they only languish in
misery in this life, and are reservcd to greater punishments here·
after3 and consequently they are sar from participating in the

XXXIX. The end of this precept is, that since God has
connected mankind together in a kind of unity, every man
ought to consider himself as charged with the safety of all.
ln short, then, all violence and injustice, and every kind of
mischies, which may injure the body of our neighbour‚ are
forbidden to us. And therefore we are enjoined, if it be in our

power, to assrst in protecting the lives of onr neighbours3 to '

exert ourselves with fidelity for this purpose ; to procure those
things which conduce to their tranquillity; to be vigilant in

- ehielding them from injuries3 and in cases of danger to afford

thern orrr assistance. lf we romernber that this is tlrc language
of the Divine Legislator, we should consider, at the same time,
that hc intends this rulc to govern the sonl. For it were
