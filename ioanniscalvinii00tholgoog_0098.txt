those human testimonies, which contributa to its confimtation,
will not be useless, if they follow that first and principal proof,
as secondary aids to our imbecility. But those persons betray
great solly, who wish it to be demonstrated to infidels that the
Scriptura is the word os God, which cannot be known without
saith. Augustino therefore justly observes, (m) that picty aud
peace of mind ought to precede, in order that a man may uu·
derataud somewhat of such great subjecte.

CHAPTER IX.

THE runnutcrsu WHICH ursctnns Tun sementina, UNDER THE

Peasorvs who, abandoning the Scriptura, imagine to them·
selves some other way os approaching to God, must be con·
sidered as not so much misled by error as actuated by fren-
zy. For there have lately arisen some unsteady men, who,
hanghtily pretending to be taught by the Spirit, reject all
reading themselves, and deride the simplicity os those who
still attend to (what they style) the dead and killing letter.
But l would ask thern, what spirit that ie, by whose inspiration
they are elevated to such a sublimity, as to dare to despise the
doctrine os the Scripture, as puerile and mean. For, if they
answer that it is the Spirit os Christ, how ridiculons is such
an assurance! for that the apostles of Christ, and other be·
lievers in the primitive Church, were illuminated by no other
Spirit, Ι think they will concede. But not aneos them learned,
from his teaching, to eontemn the Divine word ; they were
rather filled with higher reverence sor it, as their writings
abundantly testisy. This had been predicted by the mouth
os lsaiah. For where he says, “My Spirit that is upon thee,
and my words which 1 have put in thy mouth, shall not de·
part out of thy mouth, nor out os the mouth of thy seed, sor
ever,'' (a) he does not confine people under the old dispen-
sation to the external letter, as though they were children
learning to read, but declares, that it will be the true and
complete felicity οἰ the new Chnrch, under the reign os Christ,
to be governed by the word of God, as well ae by his Spirit.
