Author, the application of his name to designate the leading
principles of the system he maintained, and the frequent
collision of sentiment respecting various parts of that sys-
tem, combine with otherconsiderations to render it amatter
of wonder, that it has not long ago been given to the
English public in a new dress. The importance of it has
also been much increased by the recent controversy respect·
ing Calvinism, commenced by Dr. Tomliue, the present
Bishop of Lincoln, in which such direct and ,copious re·
ference has been made to the writings of this Reformer,
and especially to his Cunrsrnu lusrnurns. These cir·
cumstances aud considerations have led to the present
translation and publication, which, from the very respect·
able encouragement it has received, the Translator trusts
will be regarded as an acceptable service to the religious
public.

Among the different methods of translation which have
been recommended, he has adopted that which appeared
to him best fitted to the present undertaking. Aservile
adhereuce to the letter of the original, the style of which
is so very remote from the English idiom, he thought
would convey a very inadequate representation of the
work3 such extreme fidelity, to use an expression of
Cowpcr’s, being seldom successful, even in a faithful
transmission of the precise sentiments of the author to the
mind of the reader. Amere attention to the ideas and
sentimenta of the original, to the neglect of its style and
manner, would expose the Translator of a treatise of this
nature to uo small danger of misrepresenting the meaning
of the Author, by too frequent and tunnecessary deviations
from his language. He has, therefore, aimed at a medium
between servility and looscness, and endeavoured to follow
tho style of‘the original as far as the respective idioms of
the Latin and English would admit.

After the greater part of the work had been translated,
he had the happiness to meet with an edition in French,
