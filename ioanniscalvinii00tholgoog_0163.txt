there is alwaysa wide difference, even in the same work, be·
tween the operation of God and the attempta of Satan and
wicked men. He makes the evil instrumente, which he has in
his'hand, and can turn as he pleases, to be subserviant to his
justice. They, as they are evil, produce the iniquity which
the depravity of their nature has conceived. The other argu·
ments, which tend to vindicate the majesty of God from every
calumny, and to obviate the cavils of the impiatis, have already
been advanced in the chapter concaming Providence. For, at
present, l only intend briefly to show how Satan reigns in the
reprobate man, and how the Lord operatas in them both.

Vl. But what liberty man possessas in those actions which
in themselves are neither righteous nor wicked, and partein
rather to the corporeal than to the spiritual life, although we
have before hinted, has not yet been explicitly stated. Some
have admitted him in such things to possess afree choice;
rather, as 1 suppose, froin a reluctance to disputa on a subject
of no importance, than from an intention of positively assert-

themselves, believe what is principally necessary to be known
in order to salvation, yet 1 think that this point also should
not be neglected, that we may know it to be owing to the
special favour of God, whenever our mind is disposed to choose
that which is advantageous for us, whenever our will inclines
to it; and, on the other hand, whenever our mind and under-
standing avoid what would otherwise hurt us. And the power
of the providence of God⁴extends so far, as not only to cause
those events to succeed which be foresees will be best, but also
to incline the wills of men to the same objecta. Indeed, if we
viewthe administrationes external things with our own rea·
son, we shall not doubt their subjection to the human will ;
but if we listen to the numerous testimonias, which proclaim
that in these things also the hearts of men are governed by the
Lord, they will constrain us to submit the will itself to the
special influence of God. Who conciliated the minds of thc
Egyptians towards the israelites, (c) so as to induce thern to
lend them the most valuable of their fumiture? They would
never have been indnced to do this of their own accord. lt
follows, therefore, that their hearts were guided hythe Lord
rather than by an inclination cf their own. And Jacob, if he
had not been persuaded that God infusas various dispositions
into men according to his pleasure, would not have said con·
ceming his son Joseph, whom he thought to be some profane
Egyptian, “ God Almighty give you mercy before the man.'' (d)
