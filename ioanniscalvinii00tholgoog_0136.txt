of the holy city and the rnin of the temple he calls his own
work. (g) David, not murmuring against God, but acknow·
ledging him to be a righteous Judge, confesses the maledictione
of Shimei to proceed from his command. “The Lord,” says
he, “hath said unto him, Ourse.”(h) It often occurs in the
Sacred History‚ that whatever comes to pass proceeds from the
Lord; as the defection of the ten tribes, (i) the death of the
sons of Eli, (j)and many events of a similar kind. These who
are but moderately acquainted with the Scriptores will perceive
that, for the sake of brevity‚ out of a great number of testi·
monies‚ 1 have produced only a few; which, nevertheless‚ abun-

providence of God, to substitute a bare permission3 as though
God were sitting in a watchtower, expecting fortuitons
events, and so his decisions were dependent on the will of
men.

11. With respect to his secret influences‚ the declaration os
Salomon concerning the heart of a king, thet it is inclined
hithcr or thither according to the Divine will, (lc) certainly cx·
tends to the whole human rece, and is as much as though he
had said, that whatever conceptione wc form in our minds‚
they are directed by the secret inspiration of God. And cer·
tainly, if he did not operate internally 011 the human mind,
there would be no propriety in asserting that he causes “ the
wisdom of the wise to perish‚ and the understanding of the
prudent to be hid; that he poureth contempt upon princes,
and canseth thern to wonder in the wildemess, where there
is no way.'' (l) And to this alludam what we frequently read,
that men are timemus, as their hearts are possessed with his
sear. (m) Thus David departed from the camp of Saul, with·
out the knowledge of any one 3 “ because a deep sleep from
the Lord was fallen upon them all.'' (n) But nothing can be
desired more explicit thau his frequent declarations, that he
blinds the minds of men, strikes thern with giddiness, inebriates
thern with the spirit of slumbcr, fills them with infatuation,
and hardens their hearts. (o o) These passages also many per·
sons refer to permissiones though, m abandoning the repro·
bate, God permitted them to be blinded by Satan. But that
solution rs too frivolous‚ since the Holy Spirit expressly de·
clares that their blindness and infatuation are inflicted by the
righteous jndgmeut of God. He is said to have caused the
obduracy of Pharaoh's heart‚ and also to have aggravated and
confirmed it. Some elude the force of these expressions with
