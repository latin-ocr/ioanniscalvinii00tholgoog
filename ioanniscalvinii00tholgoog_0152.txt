heart, which inclines it to rebellion, and this correction, which
constrains it to obedience. But when David, perceiving him·
sels to be for a time deprived of the direction of grace, prays
that God would “ create in ’² him “a clean heart, and renewa
right spirit within ’' him, (s) does he not aclrnowledge that all
the parts of his heart are full of impurity, and his spirit warped
by a depraved obliquity? and by calling the purity which
he eamestly implores, the creation of God, does he not ascribe
it entirely to him? If any one object, that the petition itself is
aproof of a pious and holy affection, the answer is easy, that
although David had already partly repented, yet he compares
his former state with that melancholy fall, which he had ex·
perienced. Assuming the character, therefore, of a man alien·
ated from God, he properly requests for himself all those things
which God confers on his elect in regeneration. Resembling a
dead man, therefore, he prays to be created anew, that, instead
of being the slave of Satan, he may become the instrument
of the Holy Spirit. Truly wonderful and monstrous is the
extravagance of our pride. God requires of us nothing more
severe than that we most religiously observe his sabbath, by
resting from our own works3 but there is nothing which we
find more difficult, or to which we are more reluctant, than
to bid farewell to our own works, in order to give the works of
God their proper place. If there were no obstacle arising from
our folly, Christ has given a testimony to his greces, sufficiently
clear to prevent them from being wickedly suppressed. “I am
the vine,” says he, “ye are the branches. My Father is the
husbandmen. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except
it abide in the vine, no more ean ye, except ye abide in me.
For without me ye can do nothing.’'(t) 11 we cannot bear
fruit of ourselves, any more than a branch ean bud after it is
torn up from the ground, and deprived of moisture, we must
no longer seelr for any aptitude in our nature to that which is
good. There is no ambiguity in this conclusion, “ Without
me ye can do nothing.’' He does not say that we are too
wealr to be sufficient for ourselves, but reducing us to nothing,
excludes every idea of ability, however diminutive. lf, being
engrafted into Christ, we bear fruit like a vine, which derives
the energy of vegetation from the moisture of the earth, from
the dew of heaven, and from the benign influences of the sun,
1 see nothing of our own remaining in any good work, if we
preserve entire to God the honour which belongs to him. Itis
in vain to urge that frivolous subtlety, that the branch already
possesses sap, and a fructifying power, and that therefore it
does not darive all from the earth, or from the original root,

(s) salutato. (t) John xv. 1, 4, 5.
