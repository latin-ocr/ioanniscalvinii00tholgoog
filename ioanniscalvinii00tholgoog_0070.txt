tempests in various forms, and immediately, if he please, to
composa all to instantaneous serenity3 to restrain, suspended
ae it were in air, the sea, which, by its elevation, seems to
threaten the earth with continual devastation3 now raising it
in a tremendons manner, by the tumultuoue violence of the
winde, and now appeasing the waves to render it calm. To
this purpose are. the numerous praises of the power of God,
drawn from the testimonias of nature, particularly in the book
of Job, and in the prophecies of lsaiah3 which Ι now pur·
posely omit, as they will be more suitably introduced, when 1
discuss the scriptural account of the creation of the world.
Only 1 wished at present to hint, that this way of secking God,
by traciug the lineamenta which, both above and below us, ex·
hibit such a lively adumbration os him, is commo‘n to aliens,
and to those who belong to his family. His power leads us to
the consideration of his eternity3 because he, from whom all
things derive their origin, must necessarily he eternal and self·
existent. But if we inquire the reason that induced him first
to create all things, and now to preserve them, we shall find
the sole cause to be his own goodness. But though thisbe the
only cause, it should be more than sufficient to attract us to
love him; since, according to the Psalmist, (s) there is no
creature that does not participate in the effusione ο1 his mercy.

VII. In the second species of his werke, such ae happen ont
of the ordinary course of nature, the proofs of his perfectione
are equally clear. For he so regulates his providence in the
goverument of human society, that, while he exhibite, in innu-
merable wayS, his benignity and beneficence to all, he likewise
declares, by evident and daily indicatione, his clemency to tho
pious, and his severity ιο ι1ιο wicked and ungodly. For no
doubt can be entertained respecting hie punishment of fiagi-
tious crimes; inasmuch as he clearly demonstratos himself to '
be the guardian and avenger of innocence, in prospering with
his blessing the life of good men, in assisting their necessi·
ties, assuaging and comforting their sorrows, alleviating their
calamities, and providiug in all things for their safety. Nor
should it perplex or eclipee hie perpetual rule of righteonsness,
that he frequently permits the wicked and guilty for a time to
exult in impunity3 bnt suffers good men to be undeservedly
harassed with much adversity, and even to be oppressed by
the iniquitoue malice of the ungodly. We ought rather to
make a very different reflection3 that, when he clearly maui-
feete hie wrath in the punishment of one sin, he hatee all sins;
and that, since he now pasees by many sins nnpunished, there
will be a judgment hereafter, till which the punishment is de·
