modesty, and every other virtue. lt is an undeniable fact,
that we sincerely fear and worship God, whose name we de-
sire to be sanctified both by our life and by our death3 and
envy itself is constrained to bear testimony to the innoceuce
and civil integrity of some of us, who have suffered the pun·
ishment of death for that very thing which ought to be ac·
counted their highest praise. ⁸ But if the Gospel be made a
pretext for tumults, which hus not yet happened in your king·
dom, if any persons make the liberty of divine grace an ex·
cuse for the licentiousness of their vices, os whom 1 have
known many,—there are laws and legal penalties, by which
they may be punished according to their deserts; only let not
the Gospel of God be reproached for the crimes os wicked
men. You have now, Sire, the vimlent iniquity of our ca·
lumniators laid before you in a sufficient number of instances,
that you may not receive their accusatione with too credulous
an ear. -I sear 1 have gone too much into the detail, as this
presace already approaches the siae of a full apology; whereas

lintended it not to contain our defence, but only to prepare

your mind to attend to the pleading of our oause3 for, though
you are now averse and alienated from us, and even inflamed
against us, we despair not of regaining your favour, if you will
only once read with calmness and composure this our confes·
sion, which we intend as our defence before your Majesty.
But, on the contrary, if your ears are so preoccupied with the
whispers of the malevolent, as to leave no opportunity for the
accused to speak for themselves, and if those outrageous furies,
with your connivance, continue to persecute with imprison-
ments, scourges, tortures, confiscations, and flames, we shall
indeed, like sheep destined to the slaughter, be reduced to the
greatest extremities. Yet shall we in patience possess our
souls, and wait for the mighty hand of the Lord, which un·
doubtedly will in time appear, and show itself armed sor the
deliverance of the poor from their affliction, and for the pun-
ishment of their despiserS, who now exult in such perfect se·
curity. May the Lord, the Kiug of kiugS, establish your
throne with righteousness, and your kingdom with equity.
