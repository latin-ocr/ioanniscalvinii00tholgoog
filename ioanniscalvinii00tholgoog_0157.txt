precedes it is itself one.” Then follows this reason; because
it is written, “The God of my mercy shall prevent me.'’ (h)
And, “ Mercy shall follow me.'' (i) lt preventa the unwilling,
that he may will; it follows the willing, that he may not will
in vain.'' With this agrees Bernard, who introduces the Church,
saying‚ “Draw me unwilling, to make me willing ; draw me
inactiva, to make me run.''

XIII. Non,let us hear Augustine speak in his own words,
lest the sophists of the Sorbonne, those Pelagians of the present
age, according to their usual custom, accuse us of opposing the
whole current of antiquity. In this they imitate their father
Pelagius, by whom Augustino was formerly obliged to enter
into the same field of controversy. In his treatisc De corr.
et Grat, addressed to Valentine, he treats very much at large
what l shall recite briefiy, but in his own words: “That to
Adam was given the grace of persevering in good if he chose ;
that grace is given to us to will, and by willing to overcome
concupiscence. That Adam therefore had the power if he had
the will, but not the will that he might have the power; but
that it is given to us to have both the will and the power.
'I'hat the primitive liberty was apower to abstain from sin, but
that ours is much greater, being an inability to commit sin.’'
And lest he should be supposed to spealr of the perfectiori to
be enjoycd after the attainment of a state of immortality, as
Lombard misinterprets his meanIng, he presently removes this
difficulty. For he says, “ the will of tho saints is so infiamed by
the Holy Spirit, that they therefore have an ability, because
they have such a will; and that their having such a will pro-
ceeds from the operations of God.'’ For if, amidst such great
weakness‚ which still requires “ strength '³ to be “ made per·
fect'’(lc) for the repressing of pride, they were lest to their
own will, so as to have ability, through the Divino assistance,
if they were willing, and God did not operate in thern to pro·
duce that will; among so many temptations and infinnities
their will would fail, and therefore they could not possibly
persevero. The infinnity of the human will, then, is succoured,
that it may be invariably and inseparably actuated by DIvine
grace, and so, notwithstanding all its weakness‚ may not fail.
He afterwards discusses more at large how our hearts necessa·
rily follow the impulse of God; and he asserts that the Lord
draws men with their own wills, but that those wills are such as
he himself has formed. Now, we have a testimony from the
mouth of Augustine to the point which we are principally en·
deavouring to establish3 that grace is not merely offered by
the Lord to be either received or rejected, according to the froc

(h) Psalmlix.10. (ι) Psalm xxiii. 6. (lc) 2Cor. xii. 9.
