XXVI. The Anabaptists, not satislied with thi's limitation
os oaths, condemn all oaths without exception3 because the
prohibition of Christ is general: “ l say unto you, Swear not
at all. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay:
sor whatsoever is more thau these cometh of evil.'’ (a) But by
this mode os interpretation they set Christ iu opposition to the
Father, as though he descended into this world to abrogate the
Father's decrees For in the law the eternal God not only
permits an oath, as a lawsul thing, which would be sufficient to
justisy the use of it, but iu cases of necessity commands it. (y)
Now, Christ asserts, that “he and his Father are one‚” that
“ he acts only according to the commands of the Father,³’ that
“his doctrine is not os himsels,’' dcc. (z) What then? Will
they make God to contradict himself, by prohibiting and con·
demuing in our conduct that which he has before approved
and enjoined? But as the words os Christ involve some diffi-
culty, letus enter on a bries examinationes them. Here we
shall never arrive at the truth, unless we attend to the design
of Christ, and advert to the subjectos which he is there treat-
ing. His design is not to relax or to restrict the law, but to
reduce it to its true and genuine meaning, which had been
very much corrupted by the false comments ol the scribes and
Pharisees. ls we bear this iu our minds, we shall not be ot'

opinion that Christ condemned all oaths, but only those which ·

transgress the rrrle of the law. It appears to have been the
custom os the people at that time to avoid nothing but perju-
rics; whereas the law sorbids not only perjurieS, but likewise
all vain and superfluous oaths Our Lord, therefore, that in·
sallible expositores tlre law, apprizes them that it is sinful, not
only to perjure themselves, but even to swear. To swear in
what manner? In vain. But the oaths which are sanctioned
in the law he leaves without any objection. They consider
themselves as urging a very powersul argument, when they
violently insist on the particle ot all, which, nevertheless, re·
fers not to the word sacar, but to the sorms of oaths that are
there subjoined. For the error there condemned consisted,
partly, iu a supposition that in swearing by heaven and earth,
there was no interference with the name of God. Therefore,
aster the principal instance of transgression, the Lord goes on
to destroy all their subterfuges, that they may not imagine
themselves to have escaped by suppressing the name of God,
and calling heaven and earth to witness for them. For hera,
by the way, it must be remarked, that men indirectly swear by
God, though his name is not expressed; as when they sweer
by the light os lile, by' the bread which they eat, by their
