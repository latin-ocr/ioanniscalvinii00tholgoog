Those, truly, whom the Lord acknowledges as his disciples;
whom he honours with the revelation of his heaveuly philoso-
phy; whom he will have instructed iu the healthful mysteries
of his kingdom. Ι confess, indeed, as things are now eir·
cumstauced, that there are at present not a few who cannot
bear to be deprived of such books. But whence arises this
stupidity, but from being defrauded of that reaching which
alone is adopted to their instruction? In fact, those who pre·
sided over the churches, resigned to idols the office of teoch-
ing, for uo other reason but because they were themselves
dumb. Paul testifies, that in the true preaching of this gospel,
Christ is “evidently set forth,'' aud, as it were, “crucihed
before our eyes.'' (w) To what purpose, then, was the erec·
tion of so many crosses of wood and stone, silver and gold,
every where in the temples, if it had been fully and faithfully
inculcated, that Christ died that he might bear our curse on
the eroes, expiate our sins by the sacrifice of his body, cleanse
us by his blood, and, in a word, reconoile us to God the
Fathcri From this simple declaration they might learn more
than from a thousand crosses of wood or stone3 for perhaps
the avaricious fix their minds and their eyes more tenociously
on the gold and silver crosses, thau ou any part of the Divina
word.

VIII. Respeetiug the origin of idols, the generally received
opinion agrees with what is asserted iu the book of Wis-
dom;(o·) namely, that the first authors of them were persons
who paid this honour to the dead, from asuperstitious reverence
for their memory. 1 grant that this perverso custom was very
ancient, and deny not that it greatly contributed to increase
the roge of mankind after idolatry; newerthelesS, I cannot cou-
cede that it was the first cause of that evil. For it appears from

· Moses, that idols were iu use long before the introduction of that

ostentatious consecration of the images of the dead, which is
frequently mentioned by profane rvriters. When he relatas that
Rachel stole her father’s idols, (y) he speaks as of a common
corruption. Whence we may infer, that the mind os man is,
if I may he allowed the expression, a perpetual manufactory
of idols. After the deiuge, there was, as it were, a regenera-
tion of the world; but not many years elapsed before men
fabricated gods according to their own fancy. And it is prob·
able, that while the holy patriarch was yet alive, his posterity
were addioted to idolatry, so that, with the bitterest grief, he
might, with his owu eyes, behold tlte earth which God had
lately purged srom its corruptions by such a dreadful judgment,
