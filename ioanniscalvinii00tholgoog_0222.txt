before observed, such is our proueness to vanity and presump-
tion, that as soon as God is mentioned, our mind is unable to
guard itself from falling into some vain imagination. There·
fore, when God intends to apply a remedy to this evil, he
adorns his majesty with certain titles, and thus circumscribes
us with barriers, that we may not run into various follies, aud
presumptuously invent to ourselves some new deity, discerding
the living God, and settiug up au idol in his stead. For this
reason the Prophets, whenever they intend e proper designa·
tion of him, invest him, and as it were sunound him, with
those characters under which he had menifested himself to the
people of lsrael. Yet, when he is called “the God of Abra·
ham,⁷’ or “ the God of Israel,’' when he is said to reside “ be·
tweeu the cherubim,” “in the temple,’' “at Jerusalem,'’ (v)
these end similar forms 01 expression do not confine him to
one place, or to one nation; they ere only used to fix the
thoughts 01 the pious on that God, who, in the covenant which
he hes made with lsrael, has given such e representation of
himself, that it is not proper to deviato in the smallest instance
from such a model. Nevertheless, let it be concluded, that the
deliverance of the Jews is mentioned to induce them to devote
themselves with more alacrity to the service of God, who just·
ly claims a right to their obedience. But, that we may not
suppose this to have no relation to us, it behoves us to con·
sider, that the servitude of lsrael in Egypt was a type of the
spiritual captivity, in which we are all detained, till our celes·
tial Deliverer extricates us by the power of his arm, and intro·
duces us into the kingdom of liberty. As formerly, therefore,
when he designed to restore the dispersed Israelites to the wor-
ship of his name, he rescued them from the intolerable tyranny
of Pharaolr, by which they were oppressed, so now he delivers
all those, whose God he declares himself to be, from the fatal
dominiou of Satan, which was represented by that corporeal
captivity. Wherefore there is no one, whose mind ought not to
be excited to listen to the law, which ho is informed carne
from the King of kings3 from whom as all creatures derive
their origin, so it is reasonable that they should regard him es
their end in all things. Every man, 1 say, ought to welcome
the Legislator; to observe whose commands he is taught that
he is particularly chosen3 from whose benignity he expects an
abundance 01 temporal blessings,and alife 01 immortality and
glory; by whose wonderful power end mercy he knows him-
self to be delivered from the jews of death.
