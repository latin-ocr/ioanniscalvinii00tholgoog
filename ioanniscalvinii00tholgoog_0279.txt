see, therefore, the absurdity of the cavils with which impleus
men disturb the minda of the simple on this subject, to eall in
question either the righteousness of God or the truth of the

Ir was of great importance to our interests, that he, who
was to be our Mediator, should be both true God and true man.
If an inquiry be made concerning the necessity of this, it was
not indeed a simple, or, as we commonly say, an absolute
necessity, but such as arose from the heavenly decree, on
which the salvation of men depended. But our most merciful
Father has appointed that which was best for us. For since
our iniquities, like a cloud intervening between-us and him,
had entirely alienated us from the kingdom of heaven, no one
that could not approach to God could bea mediator for the
restoration of peace. But who could have approached to him?
Gould any one of the children of Adam? They, with their
parent, all dreaded the Divine presence. Gould any one of the
angela? They also stood in need of a head, by a connection
with whom they might be confirmed in a perfect and unvary-
ing adherence to their God. What, then, could be done l Our
situation was truly deplorable, unless the Divine majesty itself
would descend to us; for we could not ascend to it. Thus it
was necessary that the Son of God should become Immanuel,
that is, God with us; and this in order that there might be a
mutual union and coalition between his Divinity and the na·
ture of man; for otherwise the proximity could not be suffi-
ciently near, nor could the affinity be sufficiently strong, to
authorize us to hope that God would dwell with us. So great
was the discordance between our pollution and the perfect pu-
rity of God. Although man had remained immaculately inno-
cent, yet his condition would have been too mean for him to
approach to God without a Mediator. What, then, can he do,
after having been plunged by his fatal fall into death and hell,
defiled with so many blemishes, putrefying in his own eorrup-
tion, and, in a word, overwhelmed with every curse l lt is not
without reason, therefore, that Paul, when about to exhibit
Christ in the characteres a Mediator, expressly speaks of him
