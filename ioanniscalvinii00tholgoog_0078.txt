of the eyes3 if he should plead mental imbecility, while all
the irrational creatores instruet us. Wherefore we are justly
exeluded from all excuse for our uncertain and extravagant
deviatione, since all things conspire to show us the right way.
But, however men are chargeable with sinfully corrupting the
secds of divine knowledge, which, by the wonderful operation
of nature, are sowa in their hearts, so that they produce no
good and sair crop, yet it is beyond a doubt, that the simple
testimony magnificently borne by the creaturos to the glory of

our own brains; and confer on them the praise of righteous·

those whom he intended to unite in a inore close and familiar
connection with himself. For, seeing the mindo of all men to
be agitated with unstohle dispositions, when he had choseu
the Jews as his peculiar hook, he enclosed thern as in a sold,
that they might not wander alter the vanities of other natione.
Auditis not without cause that he preserves us in the pure
knowledge of himself by the same means3 for, otherwise, they
who seem comparatively to stand firm, would soon fall. For,
as persons who are old, or whose eyes are by any means be-
come dim, if you show thern the most beautiful book, though
they pereeive something written, but can scarcely read two
