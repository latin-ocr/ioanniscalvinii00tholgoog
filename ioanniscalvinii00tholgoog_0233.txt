baptism, or by any other blessings which they have received

from the Divina munificence. Nor does Christ in that place
prohibit them from swearing by heaven, and earth, and Jeru-
salem, in order to correct superstitiones some falsely imagine3
but rather to confute the sophistical subtlety of persons who
thought there was no crime in the foolish use of indirect oaths,
as though they were not chargeable with profaning the sacred
name of God, which is engraven, however, on all his benefits.
But the case is different, where any mortal man, or one that is
dead, or an angel, is substituted iu the place of God; as, among
idolatrous nations, adulation invented that odious form of
swearing by the life or genius of a king3 because in such
cases the deification of a creature obscures and diminishes the
glory of the only true God. But when we mean nothing but
to darive a confirmation to our assertions from the sacred name
of God, although it be done in an indirect manner, yet all such
frivolons oaths are offensive to his majesty. Christ deprives
this licentious practice of every vain excuse, by his prohibition
of swearing at all. James also aims at the same point, (a)
where he uses the language of Christ, which l have cited;
because this presumption has always been prevalent in the
world, notwithstanding it is a profanation of the name of God.
For if you refer the particle at all to the substance of swearing,

· as though every oath, without exception, were unlawful, what

means the explanation which is immediately annexed, “ Nei-
therby heaven, neither by earth,'' dae, language evidently
used in refutation of those cavils, which the Jews considered as
fumishing an excuse for their sin.

XXVII. It can no longer be'doubtful‚ therefore, to persons
of sound judgment, that the Lord, in that passage, only con-
demns those oaths which had been forbidden by the law. For
even he, who exhibited in his life an example of the perfectiori
which he inculcated, hesitated not to malre use of oaths when·
ever occasion required; and his disciples, who, we doubt not,
were obedient to their master in all things, followed the same
example. Who can dare to essert, that Paul would have
swern, if all oaths had been prohibited? But when the occa-
sion requires it, he swears without any scruple, and sometimes
even adds an imprecation, The question, however, is not yet
decided; for it is the opinion of some persons, that public
oaths are the only exceptions from this prohibition; such as
we talre when required by a magistrate; such also as princes
are accustomed to use in ratifying treatics3 or subjects, when
they swear allegiance to their princes ·, or soldicrs‚ as amilitary
test; and others of a similar kind. To this class also they
