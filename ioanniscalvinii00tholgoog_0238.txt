numbered among the ancient shadows, but are equally snitable
to all ages-though the sabbath is abrogated, yet it is still
customary among us to assemble on stated days for hearing
the word, sor breaking the mystic broad, audior public prayers;
arrd also to allow servants and labourers a remission from their
labour. That in commanding the sabbath, the Lord had regard
to both these things, cannot be doubted. The first is abun·
dantly confirmed even by the practice of the Jews. The second
is proved by Moses, in Deuteronomy, in these words: “that
thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as
thou. And remember that thou wast a servant in the land os
Egypt.'' (r) Also, in Euodus: “that thine ox and thine ass
may rest, and the sonos thy lrandrnaid, and the stranger, may
be resreshed.'' (s) Who can deny that both these things are
as proper for us as sor the Jews? Assemblies os the Church
are enjoined in the Divine word, and the necessity of themis
sufficiently known even from the experience of lis. Unless
there be stated days appointed for them, how can they be held?
According to the direction of the Apostle, “ all things '' are to
“ be done decently and in order ” among us. (t) But so far is
it srom being possible to preserve order and decorum without
this regulation, that, if it were abolished, the Church would be
in imminent danger of immediate convulsion and ruin. But
if we seel the same necessity, to relieve which the Lord en·
joined the sabbath upon the Jews, let no one plead that it does
not belong to us. For our most provident and indulgent Fa·
ther has been no loss attentive to provide sor our necessity than
sor that of tho Jews. But why, it may be asked, do we not
rather assemble on every day, that so all distinction of days
may be removed? Isincerely wish that this were practised5
and truly spiritual wisdom would be well worthy os some
portiones time being daily allotted to it; but if the infirmity
os many persons will not admit of daily assernblieS, and charity
does not permit ns to require more of them, why should we
not ohey the rule which we have imposed upon us by the will
os God?

XXXIII. 1 am obliged to be rather more diffuse on this
point, because, in the present age, some unquiet spirits have
been raising noisy contentions respecting the Lord’s day.
They complain that Christians ure tinctnred with Judaism, be-
cause they retain any observance of days. Butl reply, that
the Lord’s day is not observed by us upon the principles of
Judaism; because in this respect the difference between us
and the Jews is very great. For we celebrate it not with
scrupulous rigour, as aceremony which we conceive to be a
