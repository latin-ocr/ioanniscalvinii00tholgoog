Legislator is both necessary for us, and promised to us; and
hence it follows, that at least more is required of us than we
are capable os performing. Nor is it possible sor any cavils to
explain away that passage of Jeremiah, which assuras us, that
the covenant of God, made with his ancient people, was frus-
trated because it was merely a literal one 3 (lc) and that it can
only be confirmed by the influenoe os the Spirit, who fonnethe
heart to obediencc. Nor does their error derive any support
srom this passage: “Turn ye unto me, and lwill turn unto
you.'’ For this denotes, not that turning of God in which he
renovatos our hearts to repentance, bnt that in which he de·
clares his benevolence and kindness by external prosperity;
as by adversity he sometimes manifests his disploasure. When
the people os Israel, therefore, after having been harassed with
miseries and calamities under various forms, complained that
God was departed from them, he replies that his benignity will
not fail thern is they return to rectitudo of life, and to himself,
who is the standard of righteousness. 'Phe passage, then,is
'miserably perverted, when it is made to represent the work of
conversion as divided between God and men. We have ob-
served the greater brevity on these points, because it will be a
more suitable place sor this argument when we treat of the Law.

X. The second description os arguments is nearly allied to
the first. They allege the promises, in which God covenants
with our will; such as, “ Seek good, and not evil, that ye
may live.” “Is ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eet the
good os the land; but if ye refusa end rebel, ye shall be de·
vourcd with the sword3 for the mouth of the Lord hath spo-
ken it.’' (l) Again: “ If thou wilt put away thiue abominatione
out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove.’' “ 1f thou shalt
hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to ob-
servo and to do all his commandments which I command thee
this day, the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all
natione of the earth 3 ” (m) and other similar passages. They
consider it an absurdity and mockery, that the benefits which
the Lord offers in the promises are referred to our will, unless
it be in our power either to confirm or to frustrate them. And
truly it is very easy to amplify this subject with eloquent com·
plaints, that we are cruclly mocked by the Lord, when he an·
nounces that his benignity depends on our will, if that will be
not in our own power3 that this would be egregious liberality
in God, to present his benefits to us in such a manner, that we
should have no power to enjoy them; and that there must be
estrange certainty inhia promises, if they depend on a thing
impossible, so that· they can never be fulfilled. Concerning,
