clude, that there is another life, to which is reserved the ven·
geance due to iniquity, and the reward of righteousness.
Moreover, when we observo the faithful frequently chastised
by the Lord’s rod, we may conclude, with great certainty, that
the impious shall not always escape his vangeance. For that
is a wisc observation of Angustiae - “ If open punishment were
now inflicted for every sin, it would be supposed that nothing
would be reserved till the last jndgment. Again, if God now
did not openly punish any sin, it would be presumed that there
was no divine providence.” (o) lt must therefore be confessed,
that in each of the worlrs of God, but more especially in the
whole considered together, there is a brigbt exhibition of the
divine perfections; by which the whole human race is invited
and allnred to the knowledge of God, arrd thence to true aod
completa felicity. But, though those perfectione are most
luminoualy portrayed around ua, we only discover their prin·
cipal tendency, their use, and the eud of our contemplation of
thern, when we descend into our own selvas, and consider by
what means God displays in us his life, wisdom, and power,
aud exercises towards us his righteousness, goodness, aud
mercy. For, though David justly complains that unbelievers
are fools, because they consider not the profonnd designa of
God in the govemnrent of mankind( p) yet there is much
truth in what he says in another place -that the wonders of
Divina Wisdom in this respect exceed in number the hairs of
our head. (q) But as this argument must be treated more at
large in due course, 1 at present omit it.

XI. But, notwithstanding the clear representations given by
God in the mirror of his works, both of himself and of his
cverlasting dominion, such is our stupidity, that, always in·
attentius to these obvious testimonias, we derive no advantage
from them. For, with regard to the structure and very beau-
tiful organisation of the world, how fcw of us ara there, who,
when lifting up their eyes to heaven, or looking round on the
various regions of the earth, direct their minds to the remem-
brance os the Creator, and do not rather content themselves
with a view of his works, to the total neglect of their Author!
And with respect to those things that daily happen ont of the
ordinary course of nature, is it nottho general opinion, that
men are rolled and whirled about by tlte blind temerity of for·
tune, rather than governcd by the providence of God? Or if,
by the guidance and direction of these things, we are ever
driven (as all mcn must sometimes be) to tlte consideration of
a God, yet, when we have rashly conceived arr idea of soma
deity, we soon slide into our own carnal dreams, or depraved
