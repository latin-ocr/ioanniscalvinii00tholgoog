As the whole Ghurch confesses in the Psalms, that, when God
chose to compassionate her, he softened the hearts of the cruel
nations into clemency. (e) Agaiu, when Saul was so inflamed
with rage, as to prepare himself for war, it is expressly men·
tioned as the cause, that he was impelled by the Spirit of
God.(s) Who diverted the mind of Absalom from adoptirrg
the couusel of Ahithophel, which used to be esteemed as an
oraclei(g) Who inclined Rehoboam to be persuaded by the
counsel of the young rnen ἓ (lt) Who caused the natione, that
before were very valiant, to feel terror at the approach of the
Israelites? Rahab the harlot confessed that this was the work
of God. Who, on the other hand, dejected the minda of the
Israelites with fear and terror, but he who had threatened in
the law that he would “ send a faintncss into their hearts? ” (i)

vll. Some one will object, that these are peculiar examples,
to the rulc of which, things ought byrro means universally to
bc reduced. But I maintain, that they are sufficient to prove
that for which I contend3 that God, whencver he designa to
prepare the way for his providence, inclines and moves the
wills of men even in external things, and that their choice is
not so free, but that its liberty is subject to the will of God.
That your mind depends more on the influence of God, than
on the liberty of your own choice, you must be constrained to
conclude, whether you are willing or not, from this daily expc-
rience, that in affairs of no perplexity your judgment and un·
derstanding frequently fail ; that in undertakings not arduous
your spirits languish; on the other hand, in things the most
obscure, suitable advice is immediately offered; in things great
and perilous, your mind proves superior to every difficulty.
And thus Ι explain the observation of Salomon, “ The hearing
ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of
them.''(lc) For he appears to me to speak, not of their crea·
tion, but of the peculiar favour of God displayed in their per·
forming their functions. When he says, that “the king⁷s heart
is iu the haud of the Lord; as the rivers of water, he tumeth
it whithersoever hc will;”(l) under one species he clearly
comprehende the whole genus. For if the will of any man
be free from all subjection‚ that privilege belongs eminently to
the will of a king, which exercises a govcmment in some
measure over the wills of others; but if the will of the king
be subject to the power of God, ours cannot be exempted from
the same authority. Augustinc has a remarkable passage on
this subject: “The scripture, if it be diligently examined,
shows, not only that the good wills of men, which hc turns
from evil into good, and directs to good actions and to etemal
