Lct them also learn to beware, since we have to oppose the
Ariana ou one side, and the Sabellicus on the other, lest, while
they take offence at both these parties being deprived of all
opportunity of evasion, they· cause some suspicion that they
are themselves the disciples either of Arius or of Sabellius.
Arius confesses, “that Christ is God;'’ but maintains also,
“that he was created, and had abeginning.'’ He acknowledges
that Christ is “one with the Father ; ’' but secretly whispers
in the ears cf his disciples, that he is “united to him,’' like
the rest of the faithful, though by a singular privilege. Say
that he is consubstantiat, you tear off the mask from the
hypocrite, and yet you add nothing to the Scriptures. Sa·
bellios asserts, “that the names Father, Son, and Spirit, are
expressive of no distinction in the Godhead.'’ Say that they
are three, aud he will exclaim, that you are talking of “three
gods.” Say, “ that in the one essence ofGod thereis a triuity
of Persons,’' and you will at once express what the Scripturas
declare, and will restrain such frivolous loquacity. Now, if
any persons are prevented, by such excessivo scrupulousness,
from admitting these terms, yet not one of them can deny,
that, when the Scriptura speaks of one God, it should be un·
derstood of a uuity of substance; and that, when it speaks
of three in one essence, it denotes the Persons in this trinity.
When this is honestly confessed, we have no further concern
about words. But 1 have found, by long and frequent ex·
perience, that those who pertinaciously contend about words,
cherish some latent poison; so that it were better designedly
to provoke their resentment, than tonse obscure language for
the sake of obtaining their favour.

Vl. But, leaving the dispute about terms, l shall now enter
on the discussion of the subject itself. What 1 denominate a
Person, is a subsistence in the Divine essence, which is re·
lated to the others, and yet distinguished from them by an in·
communicable property. By the word subsistence we mean
something different from the word esseace. For, if the Word
were simply God, aud had no peculiar property, John had
been guilty of impropriety in saying that he was always with
God. (l) When he immediately adds, that tlte Word also was
God, he reminds us of the unity of the essence. But because
he could not be uttt uod, without subsisting iu the F'ather,
hence arises that subsistence, which, although inseparably con·
nected with the essence, has a peculiar mark, by which it is
distinguished from it. Now, lsay that each of the three sub·
sistences has a relation to the others, but is distinguished from
them by a peculim property. We particularly use the word
