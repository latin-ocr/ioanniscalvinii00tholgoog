ligion, already mentioned, but hath manifested himself in the
formation of every part of the world, and daily presente him·
self to public view, in such a manner, that they cannot open
their eyes without being constrained to behold him. His es·
sance indeed is incomprehensible, so that his Majesty is not 10 be
perceived by the human senses; but on all his works he hath
inscribed his glory in characters so clear, unequivocal, and
striking, that the most llliterate and stupid cannot exculpate
themselves by the plea of ignorance. 'Phe Psalmist therefore,
with great propriety, exclaims, “ He covereth himself with light
as with a germem, '' (t) as 11 he 11011 00111, that his first appear·
auce in visible apparel was at the creation 01 the world, when
he displayed those glories which are 01111 conspicuous 011 every
side. ln the same placa, the Psalmist compares the expanded
heavens 10 0 royal pavilion 3 -he says that “he layeth the
beams 01 1110 chambers in the waters; maketh the clouds his
chariot; walketh upon the wings of the wind ς ” 0011 1110110111

in tha first place, whithersoever you turn your eyes, there is
notan atomos 1110 world in which you cannot behold some
brilliant sparks 011000101 his glory. But you cannot at one
view take a survey 01 11110 most ample and beautiful machine
in all its vast extent, without being completely overwhelmed
with its infinite splendour. Whereforc the author 01 1110 Epistle
tc the Hebrews elegantly represents the worlds as the man·
ifestations 01 invisible things;(v) for the exact symmetry of
the universe is a mirror, in which we may contemplate the
otherwise invisible God. For which reason the Ρο0110101(10)
attributes to the celestial bodies a language universally known ;
for they afford a testimony of the Deity too evident to escape

’ 1110 observation even of the most ignorant people in the world.

But the Apostle more distinctly 0000110 this manifestation 10
men 01 what was useful 10 be known concerning God; “for
the invisible things 01 him from the creation of the world are
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,
even his eternal power and godhead.” (0)
