worship ye know not what: we know what we worship3 for
salvation isos the Jews.” (z) In these words he at once con·
demus all the religions of the Gentiles as false, and assignas
reason for it; because under the law the Redecmer was
promised only to the chosen people; whence it follows that no
worship has ever been acceptable to God, unless it had respect
to Christ. ν Hence also Paul affirms that all the Gentiles were
without God, and destitute of thc hope of life. (o) Now, as John
lesches us that life was from the beginning in Christ, and that
the whole world are fallen from it, (b) it is necessary to return
to that fountain3 and therefore Christ asserts himself to be the
life, as he is the author of the propitiation. And, indeed, the
celestial inheritance belongs exclusively to the children of God.
But it is very unreasonable that they should be considered in
the place and order of his children, who have not been engraf ·
ed iuto the body of his only begotten Son. And John plainly
declares that “they who believe in his name become the sons
of God.'' (c) But as it is not my design iu this place to treet
professedly of faith in Christ, these cursory hints shall at
present suffice.

ΙΙ. Tlrerefore God never showed himself propitious to his
ancient people, nor afforded thern any hope of his favour, with·
out 3 Mediator. Iforbear to speak of the legal sacrifices, by.
which the faithful were plainly and publiely instructed that
salvation was to be sought solely in that expiation, which has
been accomplished by Christ alone. 1 only essert, that the
happiness of the Church has always been founded on the
person of Christ. For though God comprehended in his
covenant all the posterity of Abraham, yet Paul judiciously
reasons, that Christ is in reality that Seed in whom all the
natious were to be blessed ; (d) since we know that the natural
descendants of that patriarch were not rechoned as his seed. For,
to say nothing of lshmael and others, what was the cause, that
of the two sons of Isaac, the tuin-brothers Esau and Jacob,
even when they were yet unborn, one should be choseu and
the other rejected? How carue it to pass that the first-born
was rejected, and that the younger obtained his birthright?
How came the majority of the people to be disinheritedl It
is evident, therefore, that the seed of Abraham is rechoned
principally in one person, and that the promised salvation was
not manifested till the coming of Christ, whose office it isto
collect what had been scattered abroad. 'Phe first adoption,
therefore, of the chosen people, depended on the grace of the
Mediator; which, though it is not so plainly expressed by
