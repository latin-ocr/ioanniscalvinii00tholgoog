of death against disobedient and rebellious children. (a) The
third is supported by Christ, who says, “God commanded,
saying, Honour thy father and mother;'’ and, “He that
curseth father or mother, let him die the death.⁴ But ye say,
Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, lt is a gift, by
whatsoever thou mightest be prolited by me, and honour not
his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus havc ye made
the commandmentof God of none effect by your tradition.’' (b)
And whenever Paul mentions this commandment, he explains
it as a requisition of obedience. (c)

XXXVII. In order to recommend it, a promise is annexed,
which is a further intimation how acceptable to God that sub·
missionis which is here enjoined. Paul employs that stimu-
lus to arouse our inattention, when hc sayS, “This is the first
commandment with promise.’' For the preceding promise, in
the first table, was not particularly conlined to one command·
ment, but extended to the whole law. Now, the true explana·
tion os this promise is, that the Lord spalre particularly to the
Israelites concerning the land which hc had promised them as
an inheritance. If the possession of that land therefore was a
pledge of the Divine goodness, we need not wonder, if it was
the Lord’s will to manifest his favour by bestowing length of
life, in order to prolong the enjoyment of the blessing con-
ferred by him. The meaning os it therefore is, Honour thy

. father and thy mother, that through the space of a long life

thou mayest enjoy the possession of the laud, which will be to
thee a testimony of my favour. But, as the whole earth is
blessed to the faithful, we justly place the present life among
the blessings we receive from God. Wherefore this promise
belongs lilrewise to us, inasmuch as the continuance of the
present life affords usa proof of the Divina benevolence. For
neither is it promised to us, nor was it promised to the Jews,
as though it contained any blesseduess in itself ; but because
to the pious it is generally a tolren of the Divine favour.
Therefore, if a son, that is obedient to his parents, happen to be
removed out of life before the age of maturity, -which is acase
of frequent occurrence, -the Lord, nevertheless, perseveres with
as much punctuality in the completion of his promise, as if he
were to reward a person with a hundred acres os land to whom
he had only promised one. The whole consists in this: We

' should consider that long life is promised to us sofar as it is

the blessing of God3 but that it is a blessing, only as it is a
proof of the favour of God, which he infinitely more richly

and substantially testifies and actually demonstratas to his .

servants in their death.
