vate it; whence we say that the commencement of regenera-
tionis an abolition of what is·from ourselves; nor unless he
also excite, actuate, impel, support, and restrain it; whence
we truly essert, that all the actions which proceed from this are
entirely of the Spirit. At the same time, we fully admit the
truth of what Angustiae teachcs, that the will is not destroyed
by grace, but rather repaired; for these two things are per·
fectly consistent-that the human will may be said to be
repaired, when, by the correction of its depravity aud perverse-
ness, it is directed according to the true standard of righteous·
ness; and also that a new will may be said to be created in
man, because the natural will is so vitiated aud corrupted, that
it necds to he formed entirely anew. Now, there is no reason
why we may not justly be said to perform that which the
Spirit of God performs in us, although our own will contributes
nothing of itself, independently of his grace. And, therefore,
we should remember what we have before cited from Augus·
tine, that many persons labour in vain to find in the human
will some good, properly its own. For whatever mixture men
study to add from the power of free will to the grace of God,
is only a corruption of it; just as if any one should dilute
good wine with dirty or bitter water. But although whatever
good there is in the human will, proceeds wholly from the
internal influeuce of the Spirit‚ yet because we have anatural
faculty of willing, we are, not without reason, said to do those
things, the praise of which God justly claims to himself ; first,
because whatever God does in uS, becomes ours by his be·
nignity, provided we do not apprehcnd it to originate from
ourselves; secondly, because the understanding is oum, the
will rs ours, and the effertis curs, which are all directed by
him to that which rs good.

XVI. The other testimonies, which they rahe together from
every quarter, will not much embarrass even persons of mo·
derate capacities, who have well digested the answers already
given. They quote this passage from Genesis: “ Unto thee
shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him ; ’' (m) or, as
they would translate the words, “ Subject to thee shall be its
appetite, aud thou shalt rule over it 3 ’² which they explain to
relate to sin, as though the Lord promised Cain, that the
power of sin should not obtain dominion over his mind, if he
would labour to overcome it. But we say that it is more
agreeable to the tenor of the contexero understand it to be
spoken concerning Abel. For the design of God in it is to
prove the iniquity of that envy, which Cain had conceived
against his brother. This he does by two reasons: first, that
