which cry; ” (c) but when God himself threatens animala with
famine, does he not plainly declara, that he feeds all living
creatores, sometimes with a smaller allcwance, sometimes
with a larger, as he pleases? It ispuerile, as 1 have already ob·
servcd, to rostram this to particular acts; whereas Christ says,
without any exception, that not a sparrow of the least velue
falls to the ground without the will of the Father.(d) Cer·
tainly, if the flight of birds be directed by the unerring coun-

sel of God, we must be constrained to consess with the Prophet‚ '

that, though “ he dwelleth on high,'' yet “he humbleth himself
to behold the things which are in heaven and in the carth.''(e)

Vl. But as we know that the world was made chiefly for
the sake of mankind, we must also observa this end in the
govemment os it. The Prophet Jeremiah exclaims, “I know

that the way of man is not in himself: itis not in man that '

walketh to direct his steps.’'(s) And Solomon: “Man's
goings are of the Lord: how can a man theu understand his
own weyl” (g) Now, let them say that man is actuated by
God according to the bias of his nature, but that he directa
that influence according to his own pleasure. li this could be
asserted with truth‚ man would have the free choice of his
own ways. That‚ perhaps, they will deny, because lre can do
nothing independently of the power of God, But since it is
evident that both the Prophet and Solomon ascribe to God
choice and appointment, as well as power, this by no means
extricates them from the difficulty. But Solomon, in another
place, beautifully reproves this temerity of men, who predeter·
mine on an end for themselves, without regard to God, as
though they were not led by his hand: “The preparation of
the heart in man,’' says he, “ and the answer of the tongue, is
from the Lord.’'(h) lt is, indeed, a ridiculous medness for
miserable men to resolve on undertaking any work independ-
ently of God, whilst they cannot even spcak a word but
what he chooses. Moreover, the Scriptura, more fully to ex·
press that nothing is transacted in the world but according to
his destination, shows that those things are subject to him
which appear most fortuitous. For what would you bc more
ready to attribute to chance, than when a limb broken off from
a tree kills a passing traveller? But very different is the de·
cision of the Lord, who acknowledges that he has delivered
him into the hand of the slayer.(i) ,th‚ likewise, does not
leave lots to the blindness os fortune? Yet the Lcrd leaves
