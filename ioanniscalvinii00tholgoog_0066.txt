initiated into thern, are thereby enabled to proceed much further
in investigating the secreta ol Divine Wisdom. Yet ignorauce
os those sciences preventa no man from such a snrvcy ot‘ the
workmanship of God, as is more than sufficient to excite bis
admiration os the Divina Architect. ln disquisitions concern·
ing the metiens ol the stars, in fixing their situations, measur-
ing their distances, and distinguishing their peculini properties,
there is need of slrill, exactness, and industry; and the provi·
dence ol God being more clearly revealed by these discoveries,
the mind ought to rise to a sublimet elevation for the contem·
plation of his glory. But since the meanest and most illiterata
os mankind, who are sumished with no other assistance than
their own eyes, cannot be ignorantes the excellence os the
Divina skill, exhibiting itsels in that endless, yet regular variety
os the innumerable celestial host, -it is evident, that the Lord
abundantly manifesta his wisdom to every individual on earth.
Thus it belongs to a man os praeminent ingenuity to examine,
with the critical exactness of Galen, the connection, the sym·
metry, the beauty, and the use os the various parts ol the hu·
man body. But the composition os the human body is univer·
sally acknowledged to be so ingenious, as to render its Mulier
the object ol deserved admiration.

have justly called man a microcosm, or world in miniature3
because he is an eminent specimen of the power, goodness,
and wisdom os God, and contains in him wonders enough to
occupy the attention os our minds, if we are not indisposed to
such a study. For this reason, Paul, having remerked that the
blind “might feel aster God and find him,” immediately adds,
that “ he is not lar from every one of us; ” (z) because every
man has undoubtedly an inward perceptiones tho celestini
goodness, by which he is quiclrened. But il, to attain some
ideas of God, it be not necessary sor us to go beyond ourselves,
what an unpardonable indolence is it in those who will not
descend into themselves that they mny find him! For the
same reason, David, having briefly celebrated the wonderful
name and honour ol God, which are universally conspicuous,
immediately exclaims, “What is man, that thou ert mindful
os him ? '’ (a) Agaim “ Out of the mouths ol babes and suck-
lings thou hest ordaincd strength.” Thus declaring not only
that the human racc is a clear mirror ol the worlrs os God, but
that even insants at the breast have tongues so eloquent sor the
publicationes his glory, that there is no necessity sor other
orators; whence he hesitates not to produce them as sully
