retain some sense of religion; so fully are the minds of men
possessed with this common principle, which is closely inter·
woven with their original composition. Now, since there has
never been a country or family, from the beginning of the
world, totally destitute of religion, it isa tacit confession,
that some sense of the Divinity is inscribed ou every beart.
Of this opinion, idolatry itself furnishes ample proof. For
we know lrow reluctantly man would degrade himself to
exalt other creaturas above him. His preference of wor-
shipping a ploce of wood or stone, to being thought to have
no god, evinces the impressiou of a Deity on the human mind
to bc very strong, the obliteratiou of which is more difficolt
than a total change of tlre natural disposition; and this is cer-
tainly changed, whenever man leaves his natural pride, and
voluntarily descende to such meannesses under the notion of
worshipping God.

11. Itis most absurd, then, to pretend, as is asserted by
some, that religion was the contrivance of a few subtle and
designing men, a political machine to confine the simple mul·
titude to their duty, while those who inculcated the worship
of God on others, were themselves far from believing that any
god existed. 1 confess, indeed, that artful men have intro·
duced many inventions into religion, to fill the vulgar with
reverence, and strike them with terror, iu order to obtain the
greater command over their minds. But this they never could
have accomplished, if the minds of men had not previously
been possessed of afinn persuasion of the existence of God,
from which the propensity to religion proceeds. And that
they who cunningly imposed on the illiterato, nuder the pre·
text of religion, were themselves wholly destitute of any
knowledge of God, is quite incredible. For though there
were some in ancient times, and many arise in the present
age, who deny the existence of God, yet, in spite of their re·
luctance, they are continually receiving proofs of what they
desire to disbelieve. We read of no one guilty of moro
audacious or unbridled contempt of the Deity than Caligula5
yet no man ever trembled with greater distress at any instance
os Divine wrath, so that ho was constrained to dread the Di·
vinity whom he professed to despise. This you may always
see exemplified in persons of similar character. For the most
audacious contemnens of God arc most alarmed, even attha
noise of a falling leaf. Whence arises this, but from the ven·
geance of the Divina Majesty, smiting their consciences the
more powerfully in proportion to their efforts to ily from it?
'Phey try every refuge to hide themselves from the Lord’s
presence, and to efface it from their minds; but their attempts
to elude it are all in vain. Thongh it may seem to disappear
