imputed righteousness os Christ. Some ot‘ the expressions ol
Calvin on the subject ol reprobation may be regarded as too un-
qualified, and we can no further endorse them than as they are
incorporated in the Presbyterian confession os Paith. 'I'he most
decidedly objectionable feature in the “Christian institutes,”
ia to be found in the explanation ot* the Fourth Commaudment,

where the author asserta the abrogation ol the Sabbath. ln
Calvin’s view, this ordinaucc was a mere type ol better bless-
ings‚ and, with the types and ceremonies of the old dispensa-
tion, was done away by the introduction os a new and better
dispensation. ln this opinion there can be no doubt that he
greatly erred5 and so universal is the conviction os the Churclr
on the perpetual obligation os the Sabbath as a moral institu-
tion, that no danger is to be apprehended from a contrary view,
even under the sanction os so great a name as that os Calvin.
[n justice to his opinion on this subject, however, it should be
stated, that he distinctly recognized not only the propriety but
tha necessity of aconsecration of stated days sor public reli-
gious services, without which regulation, he declares that “it is
so sar from being possible to preserve order and decomm, that
ri it were abolished, the Church wordd be in imminent danger
of immediate convulsiou and ruiu.²' lt is much to be lamented
lbet so great amiud should have been led astray on so im·
portant a point by attempting to avoid an opposite extreme.

The Board os Publication have been induced to undertake
thia edition, by the very generoua offer of the First and Se·
cond Presbyterian Ohnrches iu Baltimore, os which the Rev.
John Backua and the Rev. Dr. R. J. Breckinridge are respec-
tivcly Pastors, to desray the expense of stereotyping the work.
Under the direction os the Executive Committee of the Boas,
the translation has been diligently compared throughout with
the original Latin and Freuch, aud various corrections have
been made to convey the meaning ol the author more dis·
tinctly and accurately. This laborious duty has been per·
formed by a member os the Publishing Committee. The
intrinsic excellence of the work, taken in connection with the
attractive style, and comparative cheapness, of the present
edition, induces the Committee to hope, that it may be widely
circulated and carelully studied, both by the clergy and laymeu
os the Presbyterian Church.

ln behalf os the Executive Committee,

WILLIAM Μ. BNGLBS, Enrrorr.
