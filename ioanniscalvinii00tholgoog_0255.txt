works; since beyond the former sentence of Moses, and the lat-
ter of Paul, nothing furtherean be wanted to the highest perfec-
tion. For how far will he wish to proceed, who will not be
content with this instruction, by which man is directed to the
fear of God, to the spiritual worship of him, to the observance
of his commende, to persevering rectitudo in the way of the
Lord, to purity of conscience, arrd sincere faith end lore?
Hence we derive a confirmation of the foregoing exposition of
the law, which traces and finds in its precepta all the duties of
piety and love. For they who attend merely to dry and barren
elements, as though it taught thenr but half of the Divino will,
are deelared by the Apostle to have no knowledge of its end.

Lll. But because Christ and his Apostles, in reciting the
substance of the law, sometimes omit the first table, (s) many
persons are deceived in this point, who wish to extend their
tlfftnlllllbltn slllbkttlnlllltkilll
law.'’ By the word foitlr it is evident to me that he intends
truth or fidelity towards men. Some, however, in order to ex·
tend the passage to the whole law, take the word saith to mean
religion towards God. But for this there is no foundation; for
Christ is treating of those works by which man ought to prove
himself to be righteoua If we attend to this observation, we
shall oease also to wonder, why, in another place, to the inquiry of
a young man, what those commandments are by the observarroe
of which we enter into life, he only returns the following
answer: “Thou shalt do no murder, Thon shalt not commit
adultery, Thou shall not steal, Thou shalt not bear false wit·
ness, Honour thy father and thy mother 3 and, Thou shalt love
thy neighbour as thyself.'’ (t) For obedience to the first table
consisted chiefly either in the disposition of the heart, or in
ceremonies. The disposition of the heart was not risible, and
the ceremonias were diligently performed by hypocrites; but
the works of charity are such as enable ns to give a certain
evidence of righteousness. But the same occurs in the Prophets
so frequently, that it must be familiar to the reader who is but
tolerably conversant with thern. For in almost all cases when
they exhort to repentance‚ they omit the first table, and insist
on saith, judgment, mercy, and equity. Nor do they by this
method neglect the sear of God, but require substantial proof
of it from those marks. lt is well known that when they treat
of the observation of the law, they generally insist on the
second table ; because it is in it that the love of righteousness
and integrity is principally discovered. lt is unnecessary to
quote the passages as every person will os himself easily re·
mark what l have stated.
