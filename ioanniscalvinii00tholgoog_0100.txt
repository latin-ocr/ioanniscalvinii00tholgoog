Satan should insinuate himself under his name, he chooses to
be recognized by us from his image, which he bath impressed

cannot be mutable and inconsistent with himself. He must

Ill. But their cavilling objection‚ that we depend on “the
letter that killeth,” shows, that they have not escaped the pnn-
ishment due to the desprsers of the Scripture. For it is suf·
ficiently evident, that Paul is there contending against the
false apostles, (0) who, recommending the law to the exclusion
of Christ, were seducing the people from the blessings of the
New Covenant, in which the Lord engages to engrave his law
in 1110 minds of believers, and to inscribe it 00 111011 1100110.
The letter therefore is dead, and 1110 law of the Lord slays the
readers of it, where it is separated from the grace of Christ,

“ and only sounds in the ears, without affeeting the heart. But

it exhibit Christ,-it is the word of life, α0001011103 the soul,

Apostle also calls his preaching “the ministration of the
Spirit;'' (v) doubtless intending, that the Holy Spirit so ad-
heres to his own truth, which he bath expressed in the Scrip-
10100, 11101 110 only displays and excrts his power where the
word is received with due reverence and honour. Nor is this
repugnant to what I before asserted, that the word itself has
not much certainty with us, unless when confirmed by the
testimony of the Spirit. Por the Lord hath established a kind
of mutual connection between the certainty of his word and
01 1110 Spirit3 so that 0111 minds are filled with a solid rever·
enee for the word, when by the light 01 1110 Spirit we 010
enabled therein 10 behold the Divine countenance; and, on
the other hand, without the least fear of mistake, we gladly
receive the Spirit, when we recognize him in his image, that
is, in the word. 'I'his is the true state 01 1110 case. God did
