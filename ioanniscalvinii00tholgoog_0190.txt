we call.'' (o) In these words he clearly reaches us that the
faithful resort to God for assistance, with no other confidence
than because they are sheltored under the protectiou of the
king. This is to be inserted from another psalm: ‘⁴ Save, Ο
Lord! Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord ; ” (p)
where it is sufficiently evident that the faithful are invited to
Christ, that they may hope to be saved by the power of Gou·
The same thing is alluded to in another prayer, where the
whole Church implores the mercy of God: “ Let thy hand be
upon the man of thy right hand, upon the Son of man whom
thou madest strong for thyself.'’ (q) For though the author
of the psalm deplores the dissipation of all the people, yet he
ardently prays sor their restoration iu their head alone. But
when Jeremiah, after tho people were driven into exile, the

was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow

whouever the Prophets mention the restoration of the Church,
they recall the people to the promise given to David concern·
ing the perpetuity of his kingdom. Nor is this to be wondered
at; sor otherwise there would be no stability in the covenant.
To this refers the memorable answer of Isaiah. For when he
saw that his declaration concerning the raising of the siege,
and the present deliverance of Jerusalem, was rejected by that
unbelieving king, Ahaz, he makes rather an abrupt transition
to the Messiah: “ Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a
son ; ’³ (t) indirectly suggesting, that although the king aud
the people, in their perverseness, rejected the promise which
had been given them, as though they would purposely labour
to invalidate the truth of God, yct that his covcnant would
not be frustrated, but that the Redeemer should come athis
appointed time. Finally, all the Prophets, in order to display
