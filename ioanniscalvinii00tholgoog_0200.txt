disguises, and brought to light by the lau, it destroys the
miserable man in so secreta manner, thet he does not perceive
its fatal dart.

VII. Thus the law is like a mirror, in which we behold, first,
our impotence3 secondly, our iniquity, which proceeds from it 3
and lastly, the consequence of both, our obnoxiousness to the
curse3 just as a mirror represents to us the spots on our face.
For when aman is destitute of power to practise righteousness,
he must necessarily fall into the habits of sin. And sin is im·
mediately followed by the curse. Therefore the greater the
transgression of which the law convicts us, the more severe is
the judgment with which it condemnans 'I'his appears from
the observation 0f the Apostle, that “ by the law is the know-
ledge of sin.’' (a) For he there speaks only of the first office
of the law, which is experienced in sinners not yet regenerated.
'I'he same sentiment is conveyed in the following passages:
that “the law entered, that the offence might abouud ; ” (i) and
that it is therefore “ thc ministrationes death, which worketh
wrath and slayeth.’' (lc) For iniquity undoubtedly increaaes
more and more, in proportion to the clearness of that sense of
sin which strikes the conscience, because to transgression of
the law, there is then added contumacy against the lawgiver.
It remaiuS, therefore, that the law arm the Divina wrath against
the sinuer; for of itself it can only accuse, condemn, and
destroy. And, as Augustine says, if we have not the Spirit of
grace, the law serves only to convict and slay us. But this
assertion neither reflecte dishonour on the law, nor at all dero·
gates from its excellence. Certainly, if our will were wholly
conformed to the law, and ‹lisposed to obey it, the mere know·
ledge of it would evidently be sufficient to salvation. But
since our carnal arrd corrupt nature is in a state of hostility
against the spirituality of the Divine law, and not amended by
its discipline, it follows that the law, which was given for
salvation, if it could have found adequate attention, becomes
au occasion of siu and death. For since we are all convicted
of having transgressed it, the more clearly it displays the
righteousness of God, so, on the contrary, the more it detecte
our iniquity, aud the more certainly it confirms the reward of
life and salvation reserved for the righteous, so much the more
certain it makes the perdition of the wicked. These expres·
siens, therefore, are so far from being dishonourable to the law,
that they serve more illustriorrsly to recommend the Diviue
goodness. For hence it really appearsr, that our iniquity and
depravity prevent us from enjoying that blessed life which is
reveoled to all men in the law. Hence the grace of God, which
