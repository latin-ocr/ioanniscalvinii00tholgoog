to the peruaal of our writings, you will clearly discover that
doctrine to be a fatal pestilence ol souls, the firebrand, ruin,
aud destmction of tha Ghurch.

Finally, they betray great want of candour, by invidiously
repeating what great commetiens, tumults, and contentione,
have attended the preaehing of our doctrine, and what effecta
it produces in many persons. For it is unfair to charge it with
those evils which ought to be attributed to the malice of Satan.
It is the native property os the Diviue word, never to make its
appearance without disturbing Satan, and rousing his opposi-
tion. This is the most certain and uneqnivocal criterion by
which it is distinguished from salse doctrines, which arc easily
broached when they are heard with general attention, and re·

ceived with applauses by the world. Thus, in some ages,
when all things were immerged iu prolound darkness, the
prince of this world amnsed and diverted himself with the
generality of mankind, and, like another Sardanapalus, gave

a view to obscrue and finally to extinguish it. And now he
continues to attack it in both ways3 sor he endeavours to root up
this genuine seed by means of hannon force, and at tlre same
time tries every affort to choke it with his taras, that it may
not grow and produce fruit. But all his attempts will bc vain,
il we attend to the admonitions of the Lord, who hath long
ago made us acquainted with his devices, that we might not
bc caught by him unawares, and has armed us with sufficient
meanis of defence against all his assaults. But to charge the
word os God with the oditun os seditione, excitcd against it by
. wicked and rebellione men, or of sects raised by impostors, -is
not thia extreme maliguity? Yet it is not without exarnple in
