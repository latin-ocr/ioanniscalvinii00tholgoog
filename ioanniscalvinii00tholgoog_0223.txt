no other gods before him.'’ The end of this precept is, that
God chooses to have the sole preeminence, and to enjoy un-
diminished his authority among his people. To produce this
end, he enjoins us to keep at a distance from all impiety and
superstition, by which we should either diminish or obscure
the glory of his Deity ; and for the same reason he directs us
to worship and adore him in the exorciso of true piety. The
simplicity of the language almost expresses this3 for we can·
not “ have '² God without at the same time comprising all that
belongs to him. l'herefore, when he sorbids us to “ have ’' any
other gods, he implies, that we must not transfer to another
what belongs to him. But although the duties we owe toGod
are innumerable, yet they may not improperly be classed under
four general heads -adoration, a necessary branch of which is
tha spiritual obedience of the conscience; trust3 invocation;
and thanksgiving. By adoration l mean the reverence and
worship which he receives from every one of us who has sub
mitted to his majesty. Wherefore it isnot without reason that

his law; [for it is a spiritual homage which is rendered to him,
as to a sovereign King possessed of all power over our sauls]
'I'rust is a secure dependence on him arising from a knowledge
of his perfections; when ascribing to him all wisdom, right·
eousness, power, truth, and goodness, we esteem ourselves
happy only in communications from him. Invocation is the
applicationes our minds, under every pressure of necessity,
resorting to his fidelity, faithfulness, and assistance, as its only
defence. Thanksgiving is gratitude, which ascribes to him the

praise of all blessings. As the Lord permits no portion of these >

duties to be transferred to another, so he commanda them to be
wholly given to himself. Nor will it be sufficient for you to
refrain from worshipping any other god, unless you also refrain
from imitating certain nefarious despisers, who take the com-
pendious method of treating all religions with contempt. But
the observance of this precept must be preceded by true reli-
gion, leading our minds to the living God; that being endued
with tho knowledge of him, they may aspira to admira, fear,
and worship his majesty, to receive his communication of
blessings, to request his aid upon all occasions, to acknowledge
and celebrate the magnificeuco of his works, as the sole end in
all the actions of our lives. We must also beware of corrupt
superstition, by which those whose minds are diverted from the
true God, are carried about after various deities. Therefore, if
we be contented with one God, let us remember what has be·
fore been observed, that all fictitious deities must be driven far
away, and that we must not divide that worship which he
claims exclusively to himself. For it is criminal to detract
