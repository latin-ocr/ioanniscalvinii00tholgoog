who are alienated from Christ are destitute of that “ fear of the
Lord '’ which is “the beginning of wisdom.'’ (b) The virtues
which deceive us by their vain and specious appearance, will
be applauded in civil courts, and in the common estimation of
mankind3 but before the celestini tribunal they will possess no
value to merit the reward of righteousness.

V. The will, therefore, is so bound by the slavery of sin,
thet it cannot excite itself, much less devote itself to any thing
good; for such a disposition is the beginning of a conversion·
to God, which in the Scriptures is attributed solely to Divine
grace. Thus Jeremiah prays to the Lord to convert or turn
him, if he would have him to be turned. (c) Whence the
Prophet, in the same chapter, describing the spiritual redemp-
tion of the faithful, sayS, “ The Lord hath redeemed Jacob,
and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger
than he ;’' (d) alluding to the strong fetters with which the
sinueris bound as long as he is deserted by the Lord, and
continues under the yoke of the devil. Nevertheless there still
remains the faculty of will, which with the strongest propen-
sity is inclined to and rushes into sin3 for when man subject·
ed himself to this necessity, he was not deprived of his will,
but of soundness of will. Bernard properly observes, that we
all have a power to will 3 but that to will what is good, is an
advantage; to will what is evil, a defect. Theresore simply
to will belongs to man, to will what is evil, to comipt naturc3
to will what is good, to grace. Now, when Ι assert that the
will, being deprived of its liberty, is necessarily drawn or led
into evil, l should wonder, if any one considered it as a harsh
expression, since it has nothing in it absurd, nor is it unsanc·
tioued by the custom of good men. lt oflends those who
know not how to distinguish between necessity and compul-
sion. But if any one should aslr them, whether God is not ne·
cessarily good, and whether the devil is not necessarily evil,-
what answer will they make? For there is such a close con·
nection between the goodness of God and his Deity, that his be·
ing God is not more necessary than his being good. But the
devil is by his sall so alienated from communion with all that is
good, that he cando nothing but what is evil. But if any one
should sacrilegiously object, that little praise is due to God for
his goodness, which he is constrained to preserve,-shall we
not readily reply, that his inability todo evil arises from his
infinite goodness, and not from the impulse of violence?
Therefore, if a necessity of doing well impairs not the liberty
of the Divine will in doing well; if the devil, who cannot but
do evil, nevertheless sins voluntarily3 who then will essert
