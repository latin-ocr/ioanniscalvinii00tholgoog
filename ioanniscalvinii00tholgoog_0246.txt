come their necessities by vain presumption. That continence

is a peculiar gift of God, and of that kind which is not imparted
promiscuously, or to the whole body of the Church, but only
conferred on a few of its members, is affinned by our Lord.
For he mentions a certain class of men who “ have made thern·
solves eunuchs sor the kingdom of heaven’s sake 3 '' (g) that is,
that they might be more at liberty to devote their atten-
tion to the affairs os the kingdom os heaven. But that no one
might suppose this to be iu the power of man, he had already
declared that “all men cannot receive this saying, save they to
whom it is given.” And he concludes, “ He that is able to re-
ceive it, let him receive it.’' Paul is still more explicit, when
he says, that “ every man hath his proper gift of God, one after
this manner, and another aster that.” (Ιι)

XLlll. Since we are so expressly apprized that it is not in
the power of every one to preserve chastity in celibacy, even
with the most strenuous efforts for that purpose, and that it is
a peculiar grace, which the Lord confers only on particular
persons, that he may have them more ready for his service,
do we not resist God, and strive against the nature insti·
tuted by him, unless we accommodate our manner of life to
the measure of our ability? ln this commandment the Lord
prohibits adultery: therefore he requires of us purity and chas-
tity. The only way of preserving this is, that every one
should measure himself by his own capacity. Let no one
rashly despise marriage as a thing useless or unnecessary to
him; let no one prefer celibacy, unless he can dispense with
a wife. And in that state let him not consult his carnal
tranquillity or advantage, but only that, being exempted from
this restraint, he may be the more prompt and ready for all the
duties of piety. Moreover, as this benefit is conferred upon
many persons only for a season, let every one refrain from
marriage as long as he shall be capable of supporting a life of
celibacy. When his strength fails to overcome his passions,
let him consider that the Lord has laid him under a necessity
of marrying. This is evident from the directiones the Apostle:
“To avoid somication, let every man have his own wife, and
let every woman have her own husband.'' Again: “If they
cannot contain, let them marry.'' (i) Here, inthe first place,
he signifies that the majority of men are subject to the vice of
incontinence; in the next place, of those who are subject to it,
he makes no exception, but enjoins them all to have recourse
to that sole remedy which obviates unchastity. Those who
are incontinent, therefore, if they neglect this method of curing
their infirmity, are guilty of sin, in not obeying this injunction
of the Apostle. And let not him who refrains from actual for·
