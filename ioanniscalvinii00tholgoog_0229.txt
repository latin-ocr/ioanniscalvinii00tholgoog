The substance of the command therefore is, that we ought not
to profane that name by a contemptuous or irreverent use of. it.
This prohibition necessarily implies an injunction, that we stu·
diously aud carefully treat it with religious veneration. There·
fore it becomes us to regulate our thoughts aud words in such
a manner that we may uot think or speak any thing concern-
ing God ⁷and his mysteries, but with the greatest sobriety and
reverence; that in meditating on his works we may form no
opinion that is dishonourable to him. These three things, Ι
say, we ought most caresully to observe— first, that whatever
we think, and whatever we say of him, should savour os his
excellence, correspond to the sacred sublimity os his name, and
tend to the exaltation os his magnificence. Secondly, we
should not rashly and preposterously abusa his holy word and
adorable mysteries to the purposes of ambition, os avarice, or of
amusement ; but as they bear an impressiou of the dignity of
his name, they should always receive from us the honour and
esteem which belong to them. Lastly, we should not injure
his works by obloquy or detractiou, as some miserable mortals
are accustomed to d0; but whenever we mention any thing
done by him, we should celebrate it with encomiums of wis·
doru, justice, and gooduess. This is “ sanctifying ”the name of
God. ln every other case, it is violated bya vain aud crimi-
nul abuse, because it is carried beyond the limita of that legiti-
mate use, to which alone it is consecrated; aud though no
other consequence ensue, it is deprived of its dignity, and by
degrees rendered contemptible. But if it be so crimiual thus
rashly and unseasonably to introduce the name os God on
every occasion, much more so must it be to apply it to such
nefarious uses as they do, who make it subserviant to the su·
perstitions of necromancy, to horrible imprecatione, to uulawfnl
exorcismS, and to other impious incantations But an oath is
the thing principally contemplated in the command, as the
most detestublc instance of the perverse abuse os the Divine
name3 and this is done to inspire us with tha greater horror os
every specics of profanatiou os it. That this precept relatas to
the worship of God and the reverence of his name, and not to
tha equity that ought to be observed among mankind, appears
from this-that the subsequent condemnation, in the second
table, os perjury and salse witness, by which society is iujurcd,
would be a needlcss repetition, if the present precept related to
a civil duty. Resides, the division of the law requires this3
sor, as we have already observed, it is not in vain that God has
distributed the law into two tables. Wheuce wa conclude, that
in this command ha vindicates his just claims‚ and guards the
sanctity of his name, but does not teach the duties which men
owe to each other.
