· are yet unilluminated by the Spirit of God, ere, by a reverence

for the Ohurch, brought to such a docility as to submit to learn
the saith of Christ from the Gospel; and that thus the au·
thority of the Ohurch is an introduction to prepare us for the
saith of the Gospel. For we see that he will have the cer·
tainty of the pious to rest on 8 very different foundation.
Otherwise Ι do not deny his frequently urgiug on the Man-
ichees the universal consent of the Ohurob, with a view to
prove the truth of the scripture, which they rejected. Whence
his rebulre of Faustus, “ sor not submitting to the truth of the
Gospel, so founded, so' established, so gloriously celebrated,
and delivered through certain successione from the apostolic
age.'' But he nowhere insinuates that the authority which
we attribute to the Scripture dependo ou the definitione or de·
crees of men: he only produces the universal judgment of tho
Ohurch, which was very useful to his argument, and gave him
an advantage over his adversaries. lf any one desire a fuller
proof of this, let him read his treatise “Of the Adventage of
Believing ; ’² where he will find, that he recommends no other
facility of believing, than such as may efford us au introduc·
tion, and be 8 proper beginning of inquiry, as he expresses
himself 3 yet that we should nothe satisfied with mere opin-
ion, but rest upon certain 8ηά solid truth.

IV. It must be maintained, as Ι have before asserted, that
we are not established in the belief of the doctrine till we are
indubitably persuaded that God is its Author. The principal
probs, therefore, of the Scriptores is every where derived from
the character of the Divino Speaker. The prophets and apos·
tles boast not of their own genius, or any of those talents
which conciliate the faith of the hearers3 nor do they insist
on arguments from reason 3 but bring forward the secred name
of God, to compel the submission of the whole world. We
must now see how it appears, not from probable supposition,
but from clear demonstration, that this use of the divine name
is neither resh nor fallacious. Nou, if we wish to consult the
true interest of our consciences; that they may not be unstable
and wavering, the subjects of perpetual doubt, that they may
not hesitate at the smallest scruples, -this persuasion must be
sought from a highcr source than human reasons, or judg-
ments, or conjectures -even from the secret testimony of the
Spirit. lt is true that, if we were inclined to argue the point,
many things might be adduced which certainly evince, if there
be any God in heaven, that he is the Author of the Law, and
the Prophecies, and the Gospel. Even though men of learn-
ing and deep judgment rise up in oppositiou, and exert and
display all the powers of their minds in this dispute‚ yet, un·
less they are wholly lost to all sense of shame, this confession
