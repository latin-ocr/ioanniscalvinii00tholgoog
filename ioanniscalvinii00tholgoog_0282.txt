creature ; '² (s) but since the'whole Scriptores procleim, that he
was clothed iu flesh in order to become a Redeemer, it argues
excessive temerity tu imagine another cause or another end for
it. The cnd for which Christ was promised from the begin·
ning, is sufficicntly known; it was to restore a fallen world,
and to succour ruined men. Therefore under the law his
image was exhibited in sacrifices, to inspire the faithful with a
hope that God would be propitious to them, after he should be

reconciled by the expiation of their sins. And as, in all ages, ’
even before the promulgation of the law, the Mediator was
never promised without blood, we conclude that he was des-
tined by the eternal decree of God to purify the pollution of
men; because the effusion of blood is an emblem of expiation.
The prophets proclaiured and foretold him, as the future re·
conciler os God and men. As a sufficient specimen of all, we
refer to that very celebrated testimony of lsaiah, where he
predicts, that he should be smitten of God for the transgressione
of the people, that the chastisement of their peace might be
upon him ; and that he should be a priest to offer up himself
as a victim; that by his stripes others should be healed; and
that because all men had gone astray, and been dispersed like
sheep, it had pleased the Lord to afflict him and to lay on
him the iniquities of all. (g) As we are informed that Christ
is. particularly appointed by God for the relies of miserable
sinuers, all who pass these bounds are guilty of indulginga
foolish curiosity. When he himself appeared in the world, hc
declared the design of his advent to be, to appease God and
restore us from death to lif . The apostles testified the same.
Thus John, before he informs us that the Word was made flesh,
mentions the defection of man. (Ιι) . But our principa} attention
is due tn Christ himself speaking of his own office. He says,
“ God so loved the world, that hc gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
everlasting life.'’ (i) Again ε “ The hour is coming, and now is,
when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and
they that hear shall live.'' (lc) “l am the resurrection and the
life3 he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall
hc live.'’ (l) Again: “ The Son of man is corne to seve that
which was lost.'’ (nr) Again: ‘³ They that be whole need not
a physician.” (n) There would be no end, if 1 meant to quote
all the passages. The apostles with one consent call us back
to this principle3 for certainly, if hc had not come to reconcile
God, the honour of his priesthuod would have been lost, for a
priest is appointed as a Mediator to intercede between God and
