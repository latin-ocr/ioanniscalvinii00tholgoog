entire acquiescence in the Scripture, and that it is sels-authen·
ticated, carrying with it its own evidence, and ought not to be
made the subject of demonstration and arguments srom reason3
but it obtains the credit which it deserves with us by the tes·
timony of the spirit. For though it conciliate our reverence
by its intemal majesty, it never seriously affects us till it is
confirmed by the Spirit inour hearts. Therefore, being il·
luminatsd by him, we now believe the divine original os the
Scriptura, not from our own judgment or that os others, but
we esteem the certainty, that we have received it from God's
own mouth hythe ministry of men, to be superior to that of
any human judgment, and equal to that os an intuitivs percep·
tion oi God himself init. We seek not arguments or proba·
bilities to support our judgment, but submit our judgments and
understandings as to a thing conseming which it is impossible
for us to judge3 and that not like some persons, who are iu
the habitos hastily embracing what they do not understand,
which displeases them as soon as they examine ir, but because
we feel the firmest conviction that we hold an invincible truth3
nor like those unhappy men who surrender their miuds cap-
tives to superstitious, but became we perceive in it the un·
doubted energies oi the Divina power, by which we are at·
tracted aud iniiamed to an understanding and voluutary
obedience, but with a vigour and efficacy superior to the
power oi any human will or knowledge. With the greatest
justice, therefore, God exclaims by Isaish‚ (r) that the prophets
and all the people were his witnesses3 became, being taught
by prophecies, they were certain that God had spoken without
the least lallacy or ambiguity. It is such a persuasion, there·
fore, as requires no reasons 3 suche knowledge as is supported
by the highest reason, in which, indeed, the mind rests with
greater security aud constancy than in any reasons 3 it is,
finally, such a sentiment as cannot be produced but by a
revelation srorn heaven. 1 speak of nothing but what every
believer experiences in his beart, except that my language
t'alls sar short of a just explication oi the subject. 1 pass over
many things at present, because this subject will present itsels
lor discussion again iu another place. Only let it be known
here, that that alone is true saith which the Spirit of God seals
in our hearts. And with this one reason every reader oi
modesty aud docility will be satisfied: lsaiah predicte that
“all the children ” os the renovated Ohurch “shall bc taught
os God.'’ (s) Herein God deigns to confer a singular privilege
on his elect, whom he distinguishes from the rest of mankind.
