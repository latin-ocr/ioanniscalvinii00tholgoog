irn, concerning the perfectiori of the evangelical law, that it is
far superior to the old law-a maxim in many respects very
pernicious. For whenwe introduce a summary of the com·
mandments, it will appear from Moses himself what an indig-
nity this fixes on the Divine law. It certainly insinuatas that
all the sanctity of the fathers under the Old Testament, was
not very remote from hypocrisy, and draws us aside from that
one perpetual rule of righteousness. But there is not the least
difficulty in the confutationes this err0r; for they have sup·
posed that Christ made additions to the law, whereas he only
restored it to its genuine purity, by clearing it from the obscu-
rities and blemishes which it had contracted from the false·
hoods and the leaven of the Pharisees.

Vlll. lt must be observed, in the second place, that the
commands and prohibitions always imply more than the words
express; but this must be so restricted, that we may not make
it a Lesbian rule, by the assistance of which the Scriptura
may be licentiously perverted, and any sense be extorted at
ploasure from any passage. For some people, by this 1111111οε
derata and excursive liberty, cause oue person to despise the
authority of the law, and another to despair of understanding
it. Therefore, if it be possible, we must find some way that
may lead us by a straight and steady course to the will 01
God. We must inquire, l say, how far our interpretation
ought to exceed the limits of the expressions; that it may
evidently appear, not to be an appendix 01 human glossas
annexed to the Divina law, but a faithful explanation of the
pure and genuine sense 01 the legislator. lndeed, in a‘ll the
commandments, the figure synecdoche, by which a part 10011-
pressed instead of the whole, is so conspicuous that he may
justly be the objectos ridicule, who would restrict the sense
01 the law within the narrow limits of the words. lt is plain,
then, that a sober exposition os the law goes beyond the words
01 it; but how far, remains doubtful, unless some rule be laid
down. The best rule, then, Ι conceive will be, that the ex·
position be directed to the design of the precept; that in re·
gard to every precept it should be considered for what eud 11
was given. For example, every precept is either imperative
or prohibitory. The true meaning of both these kinds of pre·
cepts will immediately occur to us, 11 we consider the design
or the end of them, as the end of the fifth commandment is,
that honour may be given to thern to whom God assigns it.
The substance of this precept, then, is, that it is right, and
pleasing to God, that we should honour those on whom he has
conferred any excellence, and that contemptuous and conturna·
cinus conduct towards them is an abomination 1ο him. 'Phe
design of the first commandment is, that God alone may be
