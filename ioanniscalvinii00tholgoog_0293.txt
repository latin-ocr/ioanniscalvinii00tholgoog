For 1 do notcall it humility, if we suppose that we have any
thing left. And hitherto they have taught a pemicions hypo·
crisy, who have connected these two maxims -that we should
entertain humble thoughts of ourselves before God, and that'we
should attach some dignity to our own righteousness. Foris
we address to God a confession which is contrary to our real
sentimentS, we are guilty of telling him an impudent falsehood;
but we cannot think of ourselves as we ought to think, with·
out utterly despising every thing that may be supposed an ex·
cellence in us. When we hear, therefore, from the Psalmist,
that “God will save the afflicted people, bnt will bring down
high looks,” (n) let us consider, first, that there is no way of
salvation till we have laid aside all pride, and attained sincere
humility; secondly, that this humility is not a species of
modesty, consisting in conceding to God a small portion of
what we might justly claim, as they are called humble among
men, who neither hanghtily exalt themselves nor behave with
insolence to others, while they nevertheless entertaiu some
consciousness of excellence: this humility is the unfeigned
submission of a mind overwhelmed with a wcighty sense of its
own nrisery and poverty ; for such is the unisorm description
of it in the word of God. When the Lord speaks thus in
Zephaniah‚ “l will take away out of the midst of thee them
that rejoice in thy pride ; I will also leave in the midst of thee
an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of
the Lord ; ’' (o) does he not clearly show who are trnly humble l
even such as are afflicted with a knowledge of their own poverty.
Orr the contrary, he describes the proud as persons “rejoicing,”
because this is the usual consequence of prosperity. But to the
humble, whom he intends to save, be leaves nothing but that
“they trust in the name of the Lord.'’ 'l'hus also in Isaiah,
“ 'I'o this man will 1 look, even to him that is poor and of a
contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.⁷' (p) Again:
“Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity,
whose name is Holy; 1 dwell in the high and holy place, with
him also that is osa contrite and humble spirit, to revive the
spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite
ones.'’ (q) By the contrition so frequently mentioned, wa must
understand a wounded heart, which prevents a man from rising
when humbled in the dnst. With such contrition must our
heart be wonnded, if we desire, according to the declaration of ,
the Lord, to be exalted with the humble. If thisbe not the
case, we shall be abased by the powerful hand of God to our
shame and disgrace. (r)
