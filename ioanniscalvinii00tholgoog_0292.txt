according to their intrinsic worth, are utterly defrled and pollu-
ted; that what is commonly considered as righteousness, is, in
the Divino view, nothing but iniquity; that what is accounted
integrity, is mere pollution; and that what is reputed glory, is
real ignominy.

V. From this contemplation of the Divine perfection, let ns
not be unwilling to descend to take a view of ourselves, with·
out adulation or blind sels-love. For it is not to be wondered
at, if we are so extremely blind in this respect, since not one of
us is sufficiently cautious of that pestilent sels-indulgence, which
the Scriptura declares to be naturally inherent in us all. “ Every
way of man,’' says solomon, “is right in his own eyes.’' (s)
Again: “All the ways of aman are clean in his own eyes.’' (g)
But what follows from this? ls he absolved from gnilt by this
delusion? Not at all; but, as is immediately added, “the Lord
weigheth the spirits;” that is, while men are congratulating
themselves on account of the extemal mask of righteousness
which they wear, the Lord is at the same time weighing in
his own balance the latent impurity of their hearts. Since we
are so far from deriving any advantage, therefore, from such
blandishments, let us not voluntarily delude ourselves to our
own perdition. 'Phat we may examine ourselves properly, it
is necessary for us to summon our conscience to the tribunal of
God. For we have the greatest need of his light in order to
detect the recesses of our depravity, which otherwise are too
deeply concealed. For then only shall we clearly perceive the
soree of this language: “How can man be justified with God-
man, who is ’¹ corruption and “a worm, abominable and filthy,
and who drinketh iniquity like water? ’'(h) “ Who can bring
aclean thing out of an unclean? Not one.'’(i) Then also
we shall experiente what Job said concerning himself: “ 1s 1
justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me; if I say 1
am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.'’ (lc) For the com-
plaint, which the prophet formerly made respecting Israel, “All
we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to
his own way 3 ” (l) is applicable not only to one period of time,
but to all ages. For he there comprehende all to whom the
grace of redemption was to extend3 and the rigour of this ex-
amination ought to proceed till it shall have filled ns with
complete consternation, and thus prepared ns to receive the
grace of Christ. For he is deceived who supposes himself
capable of this enjoyrnent, without having first been trnly
humbled. It is a well-known observation, that “ God resisteth
the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.” (m)

Vl. But what means have wc of humbling ourselveS, except

by submitting, all poor and destitute, to the Divine mercy?
