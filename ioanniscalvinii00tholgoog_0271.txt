not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and
have not heard them.” (a) “ Blessed are your eyes, for they
see, and your ears, for they hear.”(l›) And, indeed, it is
reasonable that the presence os Christ should be distinguished
by the prerogativa of introducing a clearer revelation of the
mysteries of heaven. To the same purpose also is the passage,
which we have before cited from the First Epistle of Peter,

that it was revealed to them, that the principal advantage of Ι

their labours would be experienced in our times. (c)

Vll. lcome now to the third differcncc, which is taken
from Jeremiah, whose words are these: “Behold, the days
come, saith the Lord, that Iwill make a new covenant with
the house of lsrael, and with the house of J udah ; not accord-
ing to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day
that Ι took them by the hand to bring them out οξ the land of
Egypt, which my covenant they brake, althotigh Ι was a
husband to thern, saith the Lord; but this shall be the cove-
nant that I will make with the house of Israel. After those
days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts,
and write it in their hearts3 and will be their God, and they
shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man
his neighbour‚ and every man his brother, saying, Know the
Lord; forthey shall all know me, from the least of thern unto
the greatest of thern, saith the Lord; forI will forgive their
iniquity, andI will remember their sin no more.’' (d) From
this passage the apostle took occasion to institute the following
comparison between the law and the gospel: he calls the for-
mer a literal, the latter a spiritual doctrine; the former,
he says, was engraven on tables of stone, but the latter
is inscribed on the heart;(e) the former was the preaohing
of death, but the latter of life3 the former was the minis·
tration of condemnation, but the latter of righteousness; the
former is abolished, but the latter remains. As the design of
the apostle was to express the sense of the prophet, it will be
sufficient for us to consider the language of one of them, in
order to discover the meaning of both. There is, however,
some difference between them. For the apostle speaks of the
law in less honourable terms than the prophet does; and that
not simply with respect to the law itself, but, because there
were some disturbers, who were full os improper zeal for the law,
and by their perverse attachment to the ceremonias obscured
the glory of the gospel, he disputes concerning the nature of
the law with reference to their error and foolish affection sor it.
This pectdiarity in Paul, therefore, will be worthy of our obser·
