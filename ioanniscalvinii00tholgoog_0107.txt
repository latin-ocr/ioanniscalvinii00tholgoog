Divino Being iswhen the mind is transported beyond itself
with admiration. For “ the cherubim '’ covered it with their
extended wings; the veil was spread before it; and the place
itself was sufficiently concealed by its secluded situation. lt
is manifestly unreasonablc therefore to endeavour to defend im·
ages of God and of the saints, by the example of those cher·
ubim. For, pray, what was signified by those little images but
that images are not calculated to represent the Divine mysteries?
since they were formed in such a manner as, by veiling the mer-
cy seat with their wings, to prevent not only the eyes, but all
the human senscs, from prying into God, and so to restrain all
temerity. Moreover, the Prophet describes the seraphim whom
he saw in a vision, as havirig “their faces covered ; '’ (n)to
signify, that the splerrdour of the Divine glory is so great, that
even the augels themselves cannot steadfastly behold it, and
the faint sparks of it, which shiue in the engeis, are concealed
from our view. The cherubim, however, of which we are now·
speaking, are acknowledged by all persons of sound judgmeut
to have been peculiar to the old state of tutelage under the le-
gal dispensation. To adduce them, therefore, as exemplos for
the imitation of the present age, is quite absurd. For that pu-
erile period, as Imay call it, for which such rudimento were ap-
pointed, is now past. And, indeed, it is a shameful considera·
tion, that heathen writers aremare expert interpreters of the
Divino law than the papists. Juvenal reproaches and ridicules
the Jews for worshipping the white clouds and Deity of heaven.
This language‚ indeed, is perverse and impions; bnt in denying
that there was any image of God among them, he speaks with
more truth than the papists, who idly pretend that there was
some visible figure of him. But as that nation frequently broke
out into idolatry, with great and sudden impetuosity, resembling
the violent ebullition of water from a large spring, hence let us
learn the strong propensity of the human mind to idolatry, lest,
imputing to the Jews a crime common to all, we should be fas·
cinated by the ellurements of sin, and sleep the sleep of death.

lv. To the same prupose is that passage, “The idols of the
heathen arc silver and gold, the work of men's hands, '’ (o) for
the Prophet concludes, from the very materiuls, that they are
no gode, whose images are made. of gold or of silver; arrd
takes it for granted, that every conception we form of the Deity,
merely from our own understandings‚ isa foolish imagination.
He mentions gold and silver rather than clay or stone, that the
splerrdour or the value of the materials may procare no rever-
ence for the idols. But he concludes in general, that nothing
is more improbable, than that gods should be manufactumd
