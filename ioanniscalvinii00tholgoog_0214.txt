what is this to us? We are certainly bound by the same de·
claration; for the claims of the Lord on behalf of his law, that
it contains the doctrine of perfect righteousness, beyond all
doubt romain perpetually the same ; yet not contented with it,
we are wonderfully laborious in inventing and performing other
good works, one after another. The best remedy for this fault
will be aconstant attention to this reflection3 that the law was
given to us from heaven to teach us a perfect righteousness3
that in it no righteousness is taught, but that which is con-
formable to the decrees of the Divino will; that it is therefore
vain to attempt new species of works in order to merit the
favour of God, whose legitimate worship consists solely in
obedience‚ but that any pursuit of good works deviating from
the law of God is an intolerable profanation of the Divina and
real righteousness There is much truth also in the observation
of Augustine, who calls obedience to God sometimes the parent
and guardian, and sometimes the origin of all virtues

VI. But when we have given an exposition of the Divina
law, we shall then more suitably and profitably confirm what
hasbeen already advanced concerning its office and use. Be-
fore we enter, however, on the discussion of each article sepa·
rately, it will be useful to premise some things which may
contributa to a general knowledge of it. First, let it be under·
stood, that the law inculcatas a conformity of life, not only to
external probity, but also to internal and spiritual righteousness.
Now, though none ean deny this, yet very few persons pay proper
attention to it. This arises from their not considering the Le·
gislator, by whose nature we ought to estimate also the nature of
the law. If a king prohibit, by an edict,·adultery, murder, or
theft‚ no man, 1 confess, will be liable to the penalty of such
a law, who has only conceived in his mind a desire to commit-
adnltery, murder, or theft, but has not perpetrated any of them.
Because the superintendence of a mortal legislator extends only
to the external conduct, and his prohibitions are not violated
unless the crimes be actually committed. But God, whose eye
nothing escapes, and who esteems not so much the external
appearance as the purity of the heart, in the prohibition of
adultery, murder, and theft, comprises a prohibition of lust,
wrath, hatred, coveting what belongs to another, fraud, and
every similar vice. For, being a spiritual Legislator, he ad·
dresses himself to the soul as much as to the body. Now, the
murder of the soul is wrath and hatred; the theft of the soul
is evil concupiscence and avariae, the adultery of the soul is
lust. But it will be said, that human laws also relate to designs
and intentions, and not to fortuitous events. This l grant ; but
they relate to such designs and intentions as have been mani·
fested in outward actions. They examine and consider with
