will be extorted from them, that the Scriptnre exhibita the
plainest evidences that it is God who speaks in it, which
manifests its doctrine to be divine. And we shall soon see,
that all the books of the sacred Scripture very sar excel all '
other writings. n we read it with pure eyes and sonnd minda,
we shall immediately perceive the majesty os God, which will
subdue onr andacious contradictions, and compel us to obey
him. Yet it is acting a preposterons part, to endeavour to
produce sonnd t'aith in the Scripture by disputatione. Thongh,
indeed, 1 am iar from excelling in peculiar dexterity or elo·
quence, yet, is l were to contend with the most subtle de·
spisers os God, who are ambitione to display their wit and
their skill in weshening the authority of Scripture,1 trust
1 should be able, without difficulty, to silence their obstreper-
ous clamour. And, is it were os any nse to attempt a refutation
os their cavils, Ι would easily demolish the boasts which they
mutter in secret cornere. But though any one vindicatos the
sacred word of God from the aspersione of men, yet this will
not fix in their hearts that assnronce which is essential to true
piety. Religion appearing, to profane men, to oonsist wholly
in opinion, in order that they may not believe any thing on
loolish or slight grounds, they wish and expect it to be proved
by rational arguments, that Moses end the prophete spake by
divine inspiration. But I reply, that the testimony os the
Spirit is superior to all reason. For, as God alone is a sns-
ficient witness os himself in his own word, so also the word
will never gain credit in the hearts os men, till it be confirmed
by the internal testimony os the Spirit. It is necessary, there·
sore, that the same Spirit, who spake by the months os the
prophets, should penetrate into our hearts, to convince ns thet
they saithsully delivered the oracles which were divinely in·
trusted to thern. And this connection is very snitably ex·
pressed in these words: ‘⁴ My Spirit thetis upon thee, and
my word which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart ont
of thy mouth, nor out os the mouth os thy seed, nor out of the
mouth os thy seed's seed, for ever.” (q) Some good menore

minds, they are perpetually fluctuating arnidst a multitude
of doubts.
