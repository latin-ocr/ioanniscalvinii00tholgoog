the patriarch Jacob saw in a vision, yet hc displays the supe·
rior excellence of his advent by this character-that he has
opened the gate of heaven to give us free admittance into it.
III. Nevertheless, we must beware of the diabolical imagi·
nation of Servatus, who, while he designs to extol the magni·
tude of the grace of Christ, or at least professes such a design,
totally abolishes all the promises, as though they were termina·
ted together with the law. He pretends, that by saith in the
gospel we receive the completion of all the promises ; as though
there were no distinction between us aud Christ. I have just

observed, that Christ left nothing incomplete of all that was ⁷

essential to our salvation3 but it is not a fair inference, that
we already enjoy the benefits procured by him; for this would
contradict the declaration of Paul, that “hope is laid up sor
us.'’ (e) Ι grant, indeed, that when we believe in Christ, we at
the same time pass from death to life3 but we should also re-
member the observation of John, that though “we are now the
sons of God, it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we
know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we
shall see him as he is.” (s ) Though Christ, therefore, offers us
in the gospel a present plenitude of spiritual blessings, yet the
fruition of themis concealed under the custody of hope, till
we are divested of our corruptible body, and transfigured into
the glory of him who has gone before us. In the mean time,
the Holy Spirit commands us to rely on the promises3 and his
authority we ought to consider sufficient to silence all the
clamours of Servetus. For according to the testimony of Paul,
“godliness bath promise of the life that now is, andos that
which is to come ;” (g) and therefore he boasts of being an
Apostle of Christ, “according to the promise of life which isin
Christ Jesus.” (h) In another place he apprizes us that we
have the same promises which were given to the saints in
former times. (i) Finally, he represents itas the summit of
felicity, thavwe are scaled with the Holy Spirit of promise. (lt)
Nor, indeed, have we otherwise any enjoyment of Christ, any
further than as we embrace him invested with his promises.
Hence it is, that he dwells in our hearts, and yet we live like
pilgrims at a distance from him; because “ we walk by faith,
and not by sight.'’ Nor is there any contrariety in these two
positions, that we possess in Christ all that belongs to the per·
sectiones the life of heaven, and yet that faith is a vision of
invisible blessings. Only there isa difference to be observed
in the nature or quality of the promises, because the gospel
affords a clear discovery of that which tho law has represented
in shadows and types.
