and inviolable trnth of God depended on the arbitrary will of
man. For thus, with great contempt of the Holy Spirit, they
inquire, Who can assure ns that God is the author of them?
Who cau with certainty affirm, that they have been preserved
safe and uncorrupted to the present agel Who cau persuade
us that this book ought to be received with reverence, and
that expunged from the sacred number, unless all these things
were regulated by the decisions of the Church? It depende,
therefore, (say they,) on the determination of the Church, to
decide both what reverence is due to the Scriptura, and what
books are to be comprised in its canon. Thus sacrilegious
men, while they wish to introduce an unlirnited tyranny,
under the name of the Charcham totally unconcerned with
what absurdities they embarrass themselves and others, pro·
vided they can extort from the ignorant this one admission,
that the Church can do every thing. But, if thisbe true,
what will be the condition of those wretched conscienccs,
which are secking a solid assurance of eternal life, if all the
promises extant concerning it rest only on the judgment of
meu? Will the receptiou of such an answer causo their
fluctuatione to subside, and their terrors to vanish? Again,
how will the impious ridicule our faith, and all men call it in
questionis it be understood to possess only a precarious au·
thority depending on the favour of men!

ΙΙ. But such cavillera are completely refuted even by one
word of the Apostle. He testifica that the church is “built
upon the foundation of the apostles and prophcts.’'(o) If the
doctrine of the propheta and apostles bathe foundation of tha
Church, it must have been certain, antecedently to the exist·
ence of the Church. Nor is there any foundation for this
cavil, that though the Church darive its origin from the Scrip
tures, yet it remeius doubtful what writings are to be ascribed
to the prophets and apostles, unless it be determined by the
Church. For if the Christian Church has been from tho be·
ginning founded on the writiugs of tho propheta and the
preaching of the apostles, wherever that doctrine is found, the
approbation of it has certainly preceded the formation of the
Church3 since without it the Church itself had never existed.
It is a very false notion, therefore, that the power of jndging
of the Scriptura belongs to the Church, so os to make the cer·
tainty of it dependent on the Church's will. Wherefore‚ when
the Church receives it, aud seals it with her suffrage, she does
not authenticate a thing otherwise dubious or controvertible;
but, knowing it to be the truth of her God, performs a duty
of piety, by treating it with immediate veneration. But, with
regard to the question, How shall we be persuaded of its divine
