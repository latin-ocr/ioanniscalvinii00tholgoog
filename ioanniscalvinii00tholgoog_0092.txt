his appearance in public, and, accusing the people 01 infidelity,
contumacy, ingratitude, and other crimes, boast that his doc·

Vl. For this also is worthy 01 being remarked, that all his
accounts 01 miracles are connected with such unpleesant cir·
cumstances, es were calculated to stimulate all the people, 11
there had been but the smallest occasion, to a public and poe·
itive contradiction ; whence it appears, that they were induced
to coincide with him only by the ample conviction 01 their
own experience. But since the matter was too evident 101
profane writers to take the liberty 01 denying the performance
01 1111130103 by Moses, the father 01 lies has suggested the
calumny os ascribing them to magical arts. But by what
kind 01 conjecture can they pretend to charge him with having
been a magician, who had so great an abhorrence 01 that su·
perstition, as to command, that he who merely consulted
magicians and seothsayers should be stoned ? (b) Certainly
no impostor practises such juggling tricks, who does not make
it his study, 101 the sake 01 acquiring fame, to astonish the
minds 01 the vulgar. But what is the practice 01 Moses?

sufficiently clears his character from every unfavourable as·
persion. Now, 11 the events themselves be considered, what

by these circumstances hie doctrine was confirmed to all suc·
