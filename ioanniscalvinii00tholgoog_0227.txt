be understood as a declaration that the curse 01 the Lord right·
eously rests, not only 011 the person of an impious man, but
also 011 his whole family. Where it has rested, what can be
expected, but that the father, being destitute of the Spirit of
God, will lead a most flagitious life 3 and that theson, experi-
encing, in consequence 01 the iniquity of his father, a similar
dereliction by the Lord, will pursue the same path to perdition3
aud that the grandson and the great grandson, the execrable
posterity of detestable meu, will run headloug after them down
the same precipice of destruction?

XX. First let us inquire, whether such punishment be in-
consistent with the Divine justice. If the whole nature of
’ man be worthy of condemnation, we know that destmction
awaits those who are not favoured by the Lord with the commu·
nication of his grace. Nevertheless‚ they perish through their
own iniquity, and not through the unjust hatred of God. Nor
is there any 100111 1011 101 expostulation, why they are not as·
sisted by Divina grace to obtain salvation as well as others.
Since it is a punishment, therefore, inflicted 011 the impious
aud flagitious, in consequence 01 their transgressions, that
their families rernain destitute of Divina grace for many
generatione, who can bring any accusation against God for
this most righteous instance of his vengeance? But it will
be said, the Lord declares, on the contrary, that the pu·
nishment of thesin of the father shall not be transferred to
the son. Observe the subject that is treated of in that place.
'I'he Israelites, after they had been long harassed by numerous
and unceasing calamities, began to use this proverb, “The
fathers have caten sour grapes, and the clrildren’s teeth are set
on edge; ”(e) by which they insinuatcd, that sins had been
committed by their parents, the punishment of which was in·
flicted on thern who were otherwise righteous and innocent,
more through the implacable wrath of God, than through a just
severity. 'Phe Prophet armounces to thern that this is not the
case, but that they are punished for their own transgressione
and that it is incompatible with the Divino justice to punish a
righteous son for the iniquity of a wicked father. Nor is this
to be found in the pcnal sanction now under consideration.
For ifthe visitation, 01 which we are treating, be fulfilled,
when God removes from the family of the impious his grace,
the light 01 his truth, and the other means 01 salvation, the
very circumstance 01 children blinded and abandoned by hirn
being found treading in the sootsteps of their fathore, is an in-
stance of their bearing the curse in consequence of the crimes
of their parents. But their being the subjects of temporal mise·
ries, and at length 01 eternal perdition, are punishments srorn
