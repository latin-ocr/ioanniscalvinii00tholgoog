XXIII. In the first place, we have to explain what an oath
is. lt consists in calling upon God as a witness, to confirm the
tmth of any declaration that we make. For execratione which
contain manifest reproaches against God, are not worthy to be
mentioned among oaths. That such an attestation, when
rightly performed, is a species of Divine worship, is evident
from many places of Scriptura ; as when Isaiah prophesies of
the voeation of the Assyrians and Egyptians to participate in
the covenant with Israel. “They shall speak,'’ says he, “ the
language of Canaan, and swear to the Lord of hosts’' (h) By
“ swearing to the Lord ’' here is intended making a profession
of religion, Again, when he speaks of the extension of his
kingdom: ‘¹ He who blesseth himself in the earth shall blesa
himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth
shall swear by the God of truth.” (i) Jeremiah says, “ lf they
will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my
name, The Lord liveth; as they taught my people to swear by
Baal, then shall they be built irr the midst of my people.'’ (lc)
And we are justly said to profess our religion to the Lord,
when we involre his name to bear witness to us. For thereby
we confess that he is truth itself, eternal and immutable;
whom we call not only as a witness of the truth, excelling all
others, but also as the only defender of it, who is able to bring
to light things which are concealed, and in a word, as the
searcher of all hearts. For where human testimonies are
wanting, we resort for refuge to the testimony of God; and
particularly when any thing is to be affirmed, which is hidden
in the conscience. For which reason the Lord is extremely
angry with them who swear by strange gode, and interprete
that species of swearing as a proof of manifest defection from
him. “Thy children have forsalren me, and sworn by them
that are no gods.'' (l) nna he declares the atrocionsnesa of
this crime by his denunciation of punishment: “I will cut off
thern that swear by the Lord, and that swear by Malcham.’' (m)

XXIV. Now, since wa understand it to be‘ the will of the
Lord, that we should reverence his name in our catha, we
ought to use so much the mora cantion, lest, instead of reve·
rence, they betray dishonour or contempt of it. It is no trifling
insult to him, when perjury is committed in his name; and
therefore the law calls it a profanation. (a) But what remeius
to the Lord, when he is despoiled of his truth? he will then
cease to be God. But he is certainly despoiled of it, when he
is made an abettor and approver of a falsehood. Wherefore,
when Joslrua would induce Achan to a confession of the nuth,
