vealed to thern, that not unto themselves, but unto us, they did
minister the things which are now reported unto you by them
that have preached the gospel unto you.’' (o) Not that their
instructions were useless to the ancient people, or unprofitable
to themselves, but because they did not enjoy the treasure,
which God through their hands has transmitted to us. For in
the present day, the grace, which was the subject of their testi·
mony, is familiarly exhibited before our eyes3 and whereas
they had but a small taste, we have offered to us a more copious
fruition of it. Therefore Christ, who asserts that “Moses wrote
of him,” (p) nevertheless extols that measure of grace in

which we excel the Jews. Addressing his disciples, he says, .

“ Blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they
hear.” (q) “ For Ι tell you, that many prophets and kings
have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not
seen them3 and to hear those things which ye hear, and have
not heard them.’' (r) This is no small recommendation of the
evangelical revelation, that God has preferred us to those holy
fathers who were eminent for singular piety. To this declara·
tion that other passage is not at all repugnant, where Christ says,
“Abraham saw my day, and was glad.'’ (s) For though his
prospect of a thing so very remote was attended with much
obscurity, yet there was nothing wanting to the certainty of a
well founded hope3 and hence that joy which accompanied
the holy patriarch even to his death. Neither does this asser·
tion of John the Baptist, “No man hath seen God at any time;
the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he
hath declared him,⁷’ (t) exclude the pious, who had died before
his tirne, frorn a participationes the understanding and light
which shine in the person of Christ ; but, comparing their condi·
tion with ours, it teaches us that we have a clear manifestation
of those mysteries‚ of which they had only an obscure prospect
through the medium of shadows; as the author of the Epistle
to the Hebrews more copiously and excellently shows, that
estod, who at sundry times, and in divers manners, spake in
time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days
spoken nnto us by his Son.’' (v) Therefore‚ though the only
begotten Son, who is now to us “the brightness of the glory,
and the express image of the person,’' (w) of God the Father,
was formerly known to the Jews, as we have elsewhere shown
by a quotation from Paul, that he was the leader of their an·
cient deliverance from Egypt; yet this also is a truth‚ which is
asserted by the same Paul in another place, that “God, who
commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in
