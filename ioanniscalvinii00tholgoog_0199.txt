possible.'' (e) Augustino contenda, with a very powerl‘ul ar-
gument, that in this fiesh we never render to God the legiti-
mato love which we owe to him. “Love,'' says he, “is an
effectos knowledge, so that no man can persectly love God,
who has not first a complete knowledge of his goodness.
During our pilgrimago iu this world, we see through an ob·
scure medium, the consequence os this, then, is, that our love
is imperfect.'' It ought, therefore, to bc admitted without
controversy, that it is impossible in this carnal state to sulfil
the law, is we consider the impotence os our nature, as will
elsewhere bo proved also from Paul. (s)

Vl. But for the better elucidation os the subject, let us state,
in a compendious order, the office and use of what is called the
moral law. Itis contained, as sar as l understand it, in these
three points. The first is, that while it discovers the right·
eousness of God, that is, the only righteousness which is ac·
ceptable to God, it warns every one os his own unrighteousness,
places it beyond all doubt, convicta, and condemns him. For
it is necessary that man, blindod and inebriated with sels-love,
should thus be driven into a knowledge os himself, and a con·
fession os his own imbecility and impurity. Since, unless his
vanity be evidently reproved, hc is inflated with a soolish con·
fidence in his strength, andcan never be brought to perceive
its seebleness as long as he mensures it by the rulo os his own
surrey. But as soon as be begins to compare it to the difficulty
of the law, he finds his insolenco and pride immediately abate.
F'or how great soever his preconceived opinion of it, ho per·
ceives it immediately pant under so heavy a load, and then
totter, and at length sall. Thus, being instructed under the
tuition of the law, he lays aside that arrogance with which ho
was previously blinded. He must also be cured os the other
disease, of pride, with which, we have observed, he is afflictod.
As long as he is permitted to stand in his own judgment, he
substitutas hypocrisy. instead os righteousness3 contented with
which, he rises up with 1 know not what pretended righteous·
nesses, in opposition to the grace ol God. But when he is con·
strained to examine his lise according to the rules os the law,
he no longer presumes on his counterseit righteousness, but
perceives that he is at an infinite distance from holiness ; and also
that he abounds with innumerable vices, srorn which he before
supposed himself to be pure. For the evils of concupiscenco
arc concealed in such deep and intricate recesses, as easily to
elude the view of man. And it is not without cause that tho
Apostle says, “ Ι had not known lust, except the law had said,
Thou shalt not covet ς ” (g) because, unless it be stripped os its
