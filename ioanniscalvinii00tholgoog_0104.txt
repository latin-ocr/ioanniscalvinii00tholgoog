to the genuine sense of nature, used simply the name of God,
in the singular number, as though they were contented with
“ one God. And this was wisely remarked by Justin Martyr,
who for this purpose wrote a book On tlte Monarcby ⁰s God,
in which he demonstrates, from numerous testimonias, that
the unity of God was a principle universally impressed on tho
hearts of men. Tertullian also proves the same point from
the common phraseology. (b) But since all men, without ex-
ception, have by their own vanity been drawn into erroneous
notions, and so their understandings have become vain, all
their natural perception of the Divine unity has only served
to render them inexcusablc. For even the wisest of them
evidently betray the vagiant uncertainty of their minds, when
they wish for some god to assist them, and in their vows call
upon unknown and sabulone deities. Resides, in imagining
the existence of many naturas in God, though they did not
entertain such absurd notions as the ignorant vulgar concern·
ing Jupiter, Mercnry, Venus, Minerva, and the rest, they were
themselves by no means exempt from the delusions of Satan3
and, as we have already remarked, whatever subterfuges their
ingenuity has invented, none of the philosophers can exculpate
themselves from the crime of revolting from God by the cor·
ruption of his truth. For this reason Habakknlr, after con·
demning all idols, bids ns to seek “the Lord in his holy tem·
ple,'' (c) that the faithful might aoknowledge no other God
than Jehovah, who had revealed himself in his word.

Now, as the Scriptura, in consideration of the ignorance and
dulness of the human understanding, generally speaks in the
plainest manner,-whe1·e it intends to discriminate between
the true God and all false gods, it principally contrasts him
with idols3 not that it may sanction the more ingenious and

detect the folly and even madness of the world ln researches
concerning God, as long as every one adheres to his own
speculatione. That exclusive definition, therefore, which
