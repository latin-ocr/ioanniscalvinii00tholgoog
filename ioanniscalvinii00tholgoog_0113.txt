stand as objeets of worship. For the same reason, also, another
point is annexed to the precept in the law concerning adora·
tion. For as soon as men have mede a visible figure of God,
they attach Divino power to it. Such is the stupidity of
men, that they confine God to any image which they make
to represent him, aud therefore cannot but worship it. Nor is
it of any importance, whether they worship simply the idol, or
God in the idol; it is always idolatry, when Divino honours
are pald to nu idol, under any pretence whatsoever. And aa
God will not be worshipped in a superstitious or idolatrous
manner, whatever is conferred on idols is taken from him.
Let this be considered by those who seelr such miserable pre-
texts for the deferrce of thet execrable idolatry, with which,
for many ages, true religion has been overwhelmed and sub-
verted. The images, they say, are not considered as gods.
Neither were the Jews so thoughtless as not to remember, that
it was God by whose hand they had been conducted out of
Egypt, before they made the ealf. But when Aaron said that
those were the gods by whom they had been liberated from
Egypt, they boldly assented;(b) signifying, doubtless, that
they would keep iu remembrance, thet God himself was their
deliverer, while they could see him going before thern in the
celf. Nor can we believe the heathen to have been so stupid,
as to conceive that God was no other than wood and stone.
For they changed the imeges at pleasure, but always retained
iu their minds the same gods, aud there were many images
for one god, nor did they imagine to themselves gods in pro·
portion to the multitude of images: besides, they daily con-
secrated new images, but without supposing that they made

When they were charged with idolatry, the vulgar replied,
that they worshipped, not the visible figure, but the Divinity
that invisibly dwelt in it. But they, whose religion was, as
he expresses himself, more refincd, said, that they worshipped
neither the image, nor the spirit represented by it; but that
in the corporeal figure they beheld a sign of that which they
ought to worship. What is to be inferred from this, but that
all idolaters, whether Jewish or Gentile, have been guided by
the notiou which l heve mentioued? Not content with a
spiritual knowledge of God, they thought that they should
receive more clear and familiar impressione of him by means
os images. After they had once pleased themselves with such
a preposterous representation of God, they ceased not from
being deluded with new fallacies, till they imagined that God
