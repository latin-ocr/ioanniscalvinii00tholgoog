are entitled to reverence, but likewise such a remuneratiou as
their ministry deserves. But as this precept, which enjoins
subjection to superiore, is exceedingly repugnant to the depra-
vity of human nature, whose ardent desire os exaltation will
scarcely admit of subjectiou, it has therefore proposed as an ex·
ample that kind of superiority which is naturally most amiable
and least invidions3 because that might the more easily mollify
and incline our minds to a habit of submission. By that sub·
jection, therefore, which is most easy to be borne, the Lord
accustoms us by degrees to every kind of legitimate obedience;
because the reason of all is the same. For to those, to whom
he gives any pree'minence, he communicares his own authority,
as sar as is necessary for the preservation of that preeminence.
wne titles of Father, God, and Lord, are so eminently appli-
cable to him, that, whenever we hear either of them mentioued,
our minds cannot bnt be strongly affected with a sense of his
majesty. Those, therefore, on whom he bestows these titles,
he illuminatos with aray of his splendent, to render them all
honourable in their respective stations. Thus in afather we
ought to recognize something Divine; for it ia not without rea·
son that he bears oue of the titles of the Deity. Our prince,
or our lord, enjoys an honour somewhat similar to that which
is given to God.

XXXVI. Wherefore it ought not to be doubted that God
here lays down a universal rulo for our conduot; namely, that
to every one, whom we know to be placed in authority over
ns by his appointment, we should render reverence, obedience,
gratitude, and all the other services in our power. Nor does it
makeany difference, whether they are worthy of this honour,
or not. For whatever be their characters, yet it is not without
the appointment of the Divine provideuce, that they have
attained that station, on account of which the supreme Legisla-
tor has commanded them to be honoured. He has particularly
enjoined reverenoe to our parents, who have brought us into
this lise3 which nature itsels ought to teaoh ns. For those
who violate the parental authority by contempt or rebellion,
are not men, but monsters. 'Pherefore the Lord commands all
those, who are disobedient to their parents, to be put to death,
as having rendered themselves unworthy to enjoy the light, by
their disregard of those by whose means they were introduced
to it. And various appendices to the law evince the truth of
our observation, that the honour here intended consists in
reverence, obedience, and gratitude. 'Phe first the Lord con·
firms, when he commanda him to be slain who has cursed his
father or mother ; (z) for in that ease he punishes contempt.
He confirma the second, when he denounces the punishment
