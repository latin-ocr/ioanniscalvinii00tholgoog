John to all the prophets, he allots the highest degree of honour
to the preaching of the gospel, which we have elsewhere seen
is signified by “the kingdom of heaven.'’ When John himself
said that he was only, a “voice,”(p) as though he were in·

pacity of a herald, according to the prediction of Malachi:
“ Behold,I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming

In this sense he was called by Christ “a burning and a shining
light,’' (r) because the full day had not yet arrived. Yet this

trine which are in force among us: but because it is of no
small importance that this point be established, Ι shall show,
by way of appendix, since the fathers were partakers with us
of the same inheritance, and hoped for the same salvation
through the grace of our common Mediator, how far their con·
dition in this connection was different from ours. For though
the testimonies we have collected from the law and the prophets ,
in proof of this, render it sufficiently evident that the people
