discussion 01 11. Βο1 l shall content mysels with suggesting
some hints, by which 1110 minda 01 1110 pions may learn what
. ought to be their principal objects 01 investigation in Scriptura
concerning God, aud may be directed 10 0 certain end 111 that
inquiry. 1110 001 yet allude to the peculiar covenant which
distinguished the descendants 01 Abraham 110111 1110 100101 tha
nations. For in receiving, by gratuitous adoption, those who
were his enemies into the number 01 his children, God even
then 1001111001οἀ himself as a Redeemer3 but we are still 11001·
ing 01 that knowledge which relates to tho creation 01 tha
world, without ascending to Christ the Mediator. But though
11 will be usesul soon to cite some passages 11010 1110 New
Testament, (since that also demonstratas 1110 power 01 God in
the 01001100,0011111001011110110010 the conservation 01 tha
world) yet 1 wish the 100110110 be apprized 01 1110 point now

the subject prescribes. At present, then, let it suffice to under·
stand how God, the 1011001 01 heaven and earth, govems tha
world which 110 hath made. Both his paternal goodness, and

ebrated; and examples 010 given 01 1110 severity, which dis·

where his forbearance produces no salutary effecta upon the
obstinate.
