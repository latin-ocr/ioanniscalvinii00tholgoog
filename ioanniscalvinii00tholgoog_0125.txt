together. But if by exotio they mean that which is curiously
contrived‚ aud superstitiously defended, which teuds to couten-
tion more thau to edification, the use ot‘ which is either 88888-
sonable or unprofitable‚ which offenda pious ears with its harah-
ness, and seduces persons from the simplicity os the Divine
word, 1 most cordiully embraco their modest opinion. Forl
think mat we ought to speak of God with the same religious cau·
tion, which should govem our thoughts of him; since all the
thoughts that we entertain conceming him merely srom our·
solves, are-soolish, and ull our expressions absurd. But there
is a proper modium to be observed: we should seek in the
Scriptures a certain rule, both for thinking and for speaking;
by which we may regulate all the thoughts os our minds, and
all tlre words of our mouths. But what forbids our expressing,
in plainer words, those things which, in the Scriptures, are, to
our understanding, intricate and obscure, provided our expres·
sions religiously and faithfully convey the true sense os the
Scriptum, and are used with modest caution, and not without
sufficient occasion? of this, examples sufficiently numerous
are not wanting. But, when it shall have been proved, that
the Church was absolutely necessitated to use the terms Trinity
and Persona, if any one then censures the novelty of the words,
may he not be justly considered as offended at the light os the
truth? as having uo other cause of censure, but that the truth
is explained and elucidated?

IV. But such verbal novelty (if it must have this appella-
tion) is principally used, when the truth is to be asserted in
opposition to malicious cavillers, who elude it by crasty sva·
sions; of which we have too much experience in the present
day, who find great difficulty in reluting the enemies os pure
and sound doctrine: possessed os serpentine lubricity, they
escape by the most artsul expedients, unless they are vigor·
ously pursued‚ and held last when once caught. Thus the
ancients, pestered with various controversies against erroneous
dogmas, were constrained to express their sentiments with the
utmost perspicuity, that they might leave no subterfuges to
the impious, who pusiled themselves of obscure expressions,
sor the concealmeut of their errors. Unuble to resist the clear
testimonies os the Scriptures, Arius consessed Christ to be
God, and the Son os God3 and, as though this were ull that
was necessary, he pretended to agree with the Church at large.
But, at the same time, he continued to nraintain that Christ
was created, aud had 8 beginning like other creaturas. 'Po
draw the versatile subtlety os this man srorn its concealment,
the ancient Fathers proceeded surther, and declared Christ to
be the eternal Sonos the Father, and consubstantial with the
