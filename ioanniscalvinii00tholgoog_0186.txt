sleep of death, to receive the illumination of Christ. (u) And
the Lord himself speaks in a similar manner, when he says,
that “the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall
hear the voice of the Sonos God; and they that hear shall
live.'’(w) With what face can they oppose a slight allusion
against so many positive expressions? Yet let this allegory
even be admitted as a clear testimony3 what will it enable
them to extort from us? Man, they will say, is but half dead 3
therefore he has some faculty remaining entire. lgrant that
he lias a mind capable of understanding, though it attains not
to heavenly and spiritual wisdom3 he has some idea of virtue;
he has some sense of the Deity‚ though he acquires not the
true knowledge of God. But what is to be concludcd from all
this? lt certainly does not disprove the assertiou of Augustine,
which has received the general approbation even of the schools‚
that man, since his fall, has been deprived of the gifts of grace
on which salvation depends3 but that the natural ones are
corrupted and polluted. Let us hold this, then, as au undoubted
truth, which no opposition can ever shake- that the mind of
man isso completely alienated from the righteousness of God,
that it conceives, desisse, and undertakes every thing that is
impious, perverse, base, impure, and flagitious; that his heart
isso thoroughly infected by the poison of sin, that it cannot
produce any thing but what is corrupt, and that if at any time
men do any thing apparently good, yet the mind always re-
mains involved in hypocrisy and fallacious obliquity‚ and the
heart enslaved by its inward perversencss.

Tus whole human racc having perished in the person of
Adam, our original excellence and dignity‚ which we have
noticed, so far from being advantageous to us, only involves us
in greater ignominy, till God, who does not acknowlcdge the
pollution and corruption of man by sin to be his work, appears
as a Redeemer in the person of his only begotten Son. There·
fore, since we are fallen from life into death, all that knowledge
of God ssa Creator, of which we have been treating, would
be useless, unless it were succeeded by faitlr exhibiting God to
