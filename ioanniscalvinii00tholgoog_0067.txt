capable of confuting the madness of those whose diabolical
pride would wish to extinguish the name of God. Hence also
what Paul quotes from Aratus, that “ we are the offspring of
God ;”(b) since his adoming us with such great excellence
has proved him to be our Father. So, from the dictales of
common sense and experience, the heathen poeta called him
the Father of men. Nor will any man freely devote himself
to the service of God, unless he have been allured to love and
reverence him, by first experiencing his paternal love.

lv. But herein appears the vile ingratitudo of men-that,
while they ought to be proclaiming the praises of God for the
wonderful skill displayed in their formation, and the inestima-
ble bounties hc bestows on them, they are only inflated with
the greater pride. They perceive how wonderfully God works
within thern, and experience reaches them what a variety of
blessings they receive from his liberality. They are con·
strained to know, whether willingly or not, that these are
procis of his divinity: yet they suppress this knowledge in
their hearta Indead, they need not go out os themselves, pro·
vided they do not, by arrogating to themselves what is given
from heaven, smother the light which illuminatas their minda
to a clearer discovery of God. Evcn in the present day, there
are many men of monstrans dispositione, who hesitate not to
pervert all the seeds of divinity sown in the nature ol' man, in
order to bury in oblivion the name of God. How detestable
is this frenzy, that man, discovering in his body and soul a
hundred vestiges of God, should make this very excellencea
pretext for the denial of his being! They will not say that
they are distinguished from the brutas by chance; but they
ascribe it to nature, which they consider as the author of all
things, and remove God out of sight. They perceive most
exquisite workmanship in all their members, from the head to
the feet. Here also they substitute nature in the place of God.
But above all, the rapid motione of the soul, its noble faculties,
and excellent talenta, discover a Divinity not easily concealed3
unless the Epicuream, like the Cyclops, from this eminence
should audaciously wage war against God. Do all the trea-
sures of lreavenly wisdom concur in the government of a worm
five fect in length? and shall the universe bc destitute of this
privilege? To state that there is in the snul a certain ma·
chinery corresponding to every part of the body, isso far from
obscuring the divine glory, that it is rather an illustration of it.
Let Epicurus answer; what concourse of atoms iu the con·
coction of food and drink distributas part into excrements and
part into blood, and causes the several members to perform
