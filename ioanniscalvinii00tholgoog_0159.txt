lr has noW, 1 apprehend, been sufficiently proved, that man
is so enslaved by sin, as to be os his own nature incapable os
an effort, or even an aspiration, towards that which is good.
We have also laid down a distinction between enantion and
necessity, from which it appears that while he sins necessarily,
hc nevertheless sins volurrtarily. But since, while he is de·
voted to the servitude of the devil, he seems to be actuated by
his will, rather than by his own, it remains lor us to explain
the nature os both kinds ol influence. There is also this
question to be resolved, whether any thing is to be attributed

some influence os his is concerned. Augustino somcwhere
compares the human will to a horse, obedient to the direction
os his rider; and God and the devil he compares to riders.
“ Ii God rides it, he, like a sober and skilsul ridet, manages it
in a graceiul manner; stimulates its tardiness3 restrains its
immoderate celerity; repressas its wantouness and wildness;
tames its perverseuess, and conducta it into the right way.
But if the devil has taken possessiones it, he, like afoolish
and wauton rider, forces it through pathless places, hurries it
into ditcheS, drives it down over precipices, and excites it to
obstinacy and ferocity.” With this similitude, as no better
occurs, we will at present be content. When the will of a
natural man is said to be subject to tho power os the davil, so
as to be directed by it, the meaning is, not that it resists and is
compelled to a reluctant submission, as masters compel slaves
to an unwilling performance of their commands, but that,
being fascinated by tha fallacies os Satan, it necessarily sub·
mits itself to all his directions. For those whom tho Lord
does not favour with the goverument of his Spirit, he abandons,
in righteous judgment, to the influence os Satan. Wheresore
the Apostle sayS, that “ the god of this world bath blinded the
minds os them which believe not,’' who are destined to do·
structiou, “lest the light of the gospel should shine nuto
them.” (l) And in another place, that he “worketh iu the
children of disobedience.” (ru) The blinding os the wicked,
and all those enormities which attend it, are called the works
of Satan3 the cause of which must nevertheless be sought
