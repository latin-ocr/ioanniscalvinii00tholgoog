THE meurs COMMANDMENT.

Thou shall not stcal.

XLV. The end of this precept is, that, as injustice is an
abomination to God, every man may possess what belongs to
him. 'Phe sum cf it, then, is, that we are forbidden tc coret
tlrc property cs otherS, andare therefore enjoined faithfnlly to
use our endeavours to preserve to every man what justly belongs
to him. For we ought to consider, that what a man possessas
has fallen to his lot, not by a fortuitous contingency, but by
the distribution of the supreme Lord os all; and that therefore
no man can be deprived of his possessions by criminal methods,
without an injury being done to the Divina dispenset of them.

him that is weaker. Hc sees the baits with which the more
crasty trepan the imprudent. All which things are concealed
from the judgment of man, nor ever come to his knowledge.
And this kind of injury relates not only to money, orto goods‚
orto landa, but to whatever each individual is justly entitled
to; scr we defraud our neighbours of their property, if we
deny thern those kind offices, which it is our duty to perform
to them. If an idle agent or steward devour the substance of
his master, and be inattentive to the care of his domestic of·
