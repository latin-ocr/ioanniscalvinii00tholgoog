Br the knowledge of God, 1 intend not merely a notion that
there is such a Being, but also an acquaintance with whatever
we ought to know concerning Him, conducing to his glory
aad our beneffl. For we cannot with propriety say, there ia

men, lost aud condemned in themselves, appreheud God the
Redeemer in Christ the Mediator3 but only to that first and
simple knowledge, to which the genuine order of nature would
lead us, if Adam had retained his innocence. For though, in
the present ruined state of human nature, no man will ever
perceive God to be a Father, or the Author of salvation, or in

kind, and another to embrace the graccos reconciliation pro·
posed to us iu Christ. Tlrerefore, since God is first manifested,
both iu tlte structure of the world and in the general tenor of
Scripture, simply as the Creator, and afterwards reveals him·
self in the person of Christ as a Redeemer, hence arises a two·
sold knowledge of him3 of which the former is first to ba
considered, and the other will follow in its proper place. For
though our mind cannot conceive of God, without ascribing
some worship to him, it will not be sufficient merely to appre-
herrd that hc is the only proper object of universal worship aud
adoration, unless wc are also persuaded that he is the fountaiu
of all good, and seek for none but in him. This Imaintain,
not only because he sustaius the universe, as he once made it,
by his infinite power, governs it by his wisdom, preserves it
by his goodncss, and especially reigns over the human racc in
righteousness and judgment, exercising a merciful forbearance,
and defendiug them by his protection; but because there can·
not be found the least particle of wisdom, light, righteousness,
power, rectitude, or sincere truth which does not proceed from
him, and claim him sor its author: wc should therefore leam
to expect aud supplicate all these things from him, aud thank·
fully to ackuowledge what he givos us. For this sense of tlte
divine perfectioris is calculated to teach us piety, which pro·
duces religion. By piety, 1 mean a reverence and love of God,
