though in a sense somewhat different, “How should man be
just with God? If he will contend with him, 110 cannot
answer him one of a thousand.'‘ (0) Ηο10 we are plainly in·
formed respecting the righteousness of God, that it is such as
no human works can satisfy3 and such as renders it impossible
for us, 11 00000011 01 a thousand crimes, to exculpate ourselves
from one 01 them. 'Phe seme idea of this righteousuess had
very properly been entertained by Paul, that “chosen ves-
scl '' (b) 01 God, when he professed, “l am consciens to myself

’ 01 00111103; yet am I not hereby justified.’' (c)

111. Nor is it only in the sacred Scripturas that such exam·
ples are found. All pious writers discover similar sentimenta
Thus Augustino says, “The only hope of all the pions, who
310110 under this burden of corruptible flesh, aud amidst the
iufirmities of this life, is, that we have a Mediator, Jesus Christ
the righteous; and he is the propitiation 101 0111 sins'’ What
isthe meaning of this observationi If this is th‘eir only hope,
where is any confidence in worhs? For when he asserta this
to be the only one, he precludes every other. Bernard also
says, “And in fact where cau be formd safe and solid rest and
aecurity for the wealr, but in the wounds 01 the Saviour?
There l dwell with the greater security, 10 proportion to his
power to save. The world rages, the body oppresses, the devil
lies in walt to destroy.. Ido not fall, because my foundation
ison a firm rock. Ihave committed heinous sin. My con-
science is disturbed, but shall not fall into despair, because 1
shall recall to remembrance the wounds of the Lord.’' From
these considerations he afterwards concludes, “My merit,
therefore, is the compassion of the Lord: I am clearly not
destitute of merit, as long as he is not destitute of compassione.
But 11 the mercios of the Lord be a multitude of mercios, my
merits are lihewise equally numerous. Shall lsing 01 my own
righteousness? OLord, l will remember thy rightcousness
alone. For it is mine also, since he is made of God 113111οο110-
ness unto me.’' Again, in another place: ‘⁴ This is the whole
merit 01 1000 - 10 fix all his hope on him who saves the whole
man.'' Likewise in another place, retaining peace to himself,
and ascribing the glory to God, he says, “To thee let the
glory 10100111 undiminished. lt is happy for me, if 1 have
peace. The gloryl entirely renounce; lest, 11 I usurp what
is not mine, 1 lose also that which is offered me.'' ln another
place he is still more explicit: “Why should the Church be
solicitous about merits, while 11 has a stronger and more se-
cure reason for glorying in the designs os God? Yon need
not inquire 011 account of what merits we hope for blessings,
especially when you read in the prophet, ί’11100 saith the

(a) lobiam. (t)Actrix.15. (0) 1001104.
