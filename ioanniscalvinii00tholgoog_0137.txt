a fooliah cavil -thst, since Pharaoh himself is elsewhere said
to have hameued his own heart, his own will is stated ss the
cause of his obduracy3 as though these two things were at
all incompatible with each other, that man should be actuated
hy God, aud yet at the same time be active himself. ButI
retort on them their own objection; forif hordening denotes
a bare permission, Pharaoh cannot properly be charged with
being the cause of his own obstinacy. Now, how wealr and
insipid would be such an interpretation, as though Pharaoh
only permitted himself to be hardened! Besidee, the Scriptnre
cuts off all occasion for such cavils. God says, “ 1 will horden
his heart.’' (p) So, also, Moses says, concerning the inhabitants
of Canaan, that they marched forth to battle, because the Lord
had hardened their beans, (q) which is likewise repeated by
· another Prophet—“He turned their hearts to hate his peo-
ple.'' (r) Thus, also, in Isaiah, he declares he will “send the
Assyrian against a hypocritical aetion, and will give him a
charge to take the spoil, and to take the prey;'’ (s) not that
he meant to teach impious and refractory meu a voluntary
obedience, but because he would incline them to execute his
judgments, just as if they had his commands engraven on their·
minds. Hence it appears that they were impelled by the pos·
itive appointment of God. 1 grant, indeed, that God often
actuates the reprobate by the interposition of Satan, but in
such a manner that Satan himself acts his part by the Divine

the Lord3 ’² (t) to teach us thet Saul's medness proceeded from
the righteous veugeance of God. Satan is also said to blind
“the minds of thern which believe not ς ” (a) but the strength
of the delusion proceeds from God himself, “that they should
believe a lie, who believe not the truth.’'(c) According to
one view of the subject, it is said, “ lf the prophet be deceived
when he heth spoken a thing, Ithe Lord have deceived that
prophetfl (ro ro) But ,according to another, God rs said himself
t0“ give men over to a reprobate mind,' ’r( )and to the vilest
iuste, because he rs the principal author of his own righteous
veugeancc, and Satan rs only the dispenser of 1t. But as we
must discuss this subject again in the second book, where we
shall trent of the freedom or slavery of the human will, l think
1 have now said, in a brief manner, as much as the occasion rc·
quired. The whole may be summcd up thus; that, as the will
of God is said to be the cause of all things, his providence is
established as the governor in all the counsels and works of
