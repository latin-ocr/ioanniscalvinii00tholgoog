second table, therefore, we shall inculcata in vain, unless 001 in·
struction be founded on the 1001 and reverence of God. To
divide the prohibition of concupiscence into two precepts, the
discerning reader, without any comment of mine, will pro·
1100000 10 110 0 corrupt and violent separation 01 what is but
one. Nor is the repetitiones this phrase, “Thou shalt not
covet,'’ any objection against us; because, having mentioned
the house or family, God enumerates the different parts 01 11,
beginning with the wife. Hence it clearly appears that it
ought to be read, as it is correctly read by the Hebrews, in one
continued connectinn; and in short, that God commanda, 11101
011 11101 every man possessos remain safe and entire, not only
frorn any actual injury or fraudulent intention, but even from
the least emotion of cupidity that can solicit our 1100110.

LI. But what is the tendcncy of the whole law, will not
now be difficult to judge: it is to a perfectiones righteousness,
11101 11 may form 1110 1110 01 man after the example os 1110 Di·
vino purity. For God has 00 delineated his own character in
it, that the man who exemplifies in his actions the precepts it
contains, will exhibit in his life, as it were, an image 01 God.
Wherefore, when Moses would recall 1110 substance of it 10 1110
1011101010οηοο 01 1110 Israelites, he said, “ And now, lsrael, what
doth 1110 Lord thy God require 01 11100, but to sear the Lord
thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and 10 serve
1110 Lord thy God with all thy beart, and with 011 thy soul, to
keep the eommaudments os 1110 Lord 1 '' (o) Nor did 110 cease
10 reiterata the same things to them, whenever hc intended to
point out the end of the law. 'Phe tendcncy 01 1110 (10011100
01 1110 law is 10 connect man with his God, and, 00 Moses else·
where expresses it, to make him cleave to the Lord in sanctity
01 111 . (p) NoW, the perfectiori 01 11110 sanctity consists in two
principal points, already recited - ‘¹ that wc love the Lord our
' God with 011 001 110011, and with all our soul, and with 011001
strength, and with all our mind; and our neighbour as our·
selves.'’ (q) And the first is, that 00100010 be completely
filled with the love 01 God. From this the love 01 001 001311·
bour will naturally follow; as 1110 Apostle signifies, when 110
says, that “the end of the commandment is charityout 01 0
pure 110011, and 01 0 good conscience, and 01 saith unfeigned.’' (r)
Here we find 0 30011 conscience and saith unfeigned, that is, in
aword, true piety‚ stated to be the grand source from which
charity is derived. He is deceived, therefore, who supposes
11101 1110 law teaches nothing but certain rudimenta and first
principles 01 11311100000000, by which men are introduced to the
commencement, but are 1101 directed to the true goal 01 good
