cf God have 110101 had any other 11110 01 religion and piety, yet
because some writers have raised many disputes concaming the
difference of 1110 Old and New Testamenta, which may occasion
doubts iu the mind 01 an undiscerning 1001101, we shall assign 0
particular chapter 101 the better and more accurate discussion 01
this subject. Moreover, what would otherwise have been very
useful, has now been rendered necessary for us by Servatus and
001110 medmen 011110 000101 the Anabaptists, who entertain
110 other ideas 01 the Israelitish nation, than 01 0 herd 01 swina,
whom they pretend to have been pampered by 1110 Lord 111 this
world, without 1110 least hope 01 01011110 immortality in heaven.
'l'o defend the picus mind, therefore, from 11110 pestilent error,
and at the same time to remove all difficulties which may arise
1101111110 mention of a diversity between the Old and New
Testamenta, 101 110, 00 we proceed, examine what similarity
there is between them, and what difference3 what covenant
1110 Lord made with the 1010011100, 111 ancient times, before the
advent 01 Christ, and what 110 has entered into with us since
hia manifestation in the flesh.

11. And, indeed, both these topics may be despatched in one
word. 'l'he covenant 01 all the fathers is 00 101 110111 differing
substantially 110111 01110, that it is the very 001110 ; it only varies
in 1110 administration. But as such extreme bravity would not
courcy to any 1110110 clear understanding 01 the subject, itis
necessary, 11 we would do any good, to proceed to a more
diffuse explication of it. But in showing their similarity, or
rather unity, it will be needless to recapitulata all the particu-
· lars which 11010 already been mentioned, aud unseasonable to
introduce those things which remaiu 10 be discussed in some
other place. We must here insist chiefly ou three priucipal
points. We 11010 to maintain, First, that carnal opulence and
felicity were not proposed to the Jews as the mark towards
whichthey should ultimately aspira, but that they were adopt·
ed to the hope 01 immortality, arrd that the truth os this adop-
tion was certified to them by oracles, by the law, aud by the pro·
pheta. Secondly, that the covenant, by which they were united
to the Lord, was founded, not on any 1110111001 1110110, buton
the mere mercy of God who called them. Γ11111111, that they
both possessed aud knew Christ as the Mediator, by whom
they were united 10 God, and became partakers 01 his promises.

The second 01 those points, as perhaps it is not yet sufficieutly
known, shall be demonstrated at large in its proper place. For
we shall prove by numerous and explicit testimonias of the
, propheta, that whatever blessing the Lord ever gave or promised
10 his peoplc, proceeded from his indulgent gooduess. The
third point has been clearly demonstrated iu several places.
And we 11010 1101 wholly neglectcd the first.
