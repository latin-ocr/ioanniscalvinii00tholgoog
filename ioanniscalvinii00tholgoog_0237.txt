his own example might operate as a stronger stimulus to the
people, or at least to apprize thern that the only andos the
sabbath was to promote their conformity to their Creator. For
thiais of little importasse, provided we retain the mystery,
which is principally exhibited, of a perpetual rest from our
own works. To the contemplation of this, the Propheta used
frequently to recall the Jews, that they might not suppose
themselves to have discharged their duty merely by a cessation
from manual labours. Beside the passages already cited, we
bave the following in Isaiah: “ Is thou turn away thy soot
from the sabbath, srom doing thy pleasura on my holy day3
y andoali the sabbath a delight, the holy ol the Lord, honour-
able3 and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways,
nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words3
theu shalt thou delight thysels in the Lord,” dec. (o) But all
that it contained osa ceremonia] nature was without doubt
abolished by the advent os the Lord Christ. For ha is the
truth, at whose presence all figures disappear3 the body, at
the sight os which all the shadows are relinquished. He,
lsay, is the true sullilment ot' the sabbath. Having been
“ buried with hirn by baptism, we have been planted together
in the likeness of his death, that being partakers of his resur-
rection, we may wallr in newness os lisc.’' (p) Therefore the
Apostle says in another place, that “ the sabbath was a shadow
of things to come ; but the body is of Christ ; ” (q) that is, the
real substance of the truth, which he has beautifully explained
in that passage. This is contained not in one day, but iu the
whole course of our· life, till, being wholly dead to oursclves‚
we be filled with the lise of God. Christians therefore ought
to depart fronr all superstitious observance of days.
