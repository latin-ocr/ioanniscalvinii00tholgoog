there remains no room for merits, if they origiuate not from
free will; but in their opinion of the erroneousness 01 our
sentiment they are greatly mistaken. For Augustine hesitates
not on all occasions to inculcata as certain, what they think it
impious to aclrnowledge; as where he says, “What are the
merita of any mani When he comes not with amerited re·
ward, but with free grace, he alone being free and a deliverer
from sins, finds all men sinuers.’' Again: ‘⁴ 11 you receive
what is your due, you must be punished. What then is done?
God has given you not merited punishment, but uumerited
grace. 11 you wish 10 be excluded from grace, boast your
merits.’' Again: “Yon are nothing of yourself; sins are
yours, merits belong 10 God; you deserve punishment; and
when you corne to be rewarded, he will crown his own gifts,
not your merits.” In the same sense he elsewhere tenches
that grace proceeds not from merit, but merit from grace.
And a little after he concludes, that God with his gifts pre-
cedes all urerits, that thence he may elicit his other merita, and
gives altogether freely, because he discovers nothing as e cause
01 salvation. But what necessity is there 101 further quota·
tiens, when his writings are full of such passages? But the
Apostle will even better deliver them from this error, if they
will hear from what origin he deduces the glory 01 the saints.
‘⁴ Whom he did predestinate, them he also called, aud whom
he called, them he also justified3 aud whom he justified, them
he also glorified.” (m) Why, then, according 1ο the Apostle,
ere the faithful crowned? Because by the mercy of the Lord,
aud not by their own industry, they are elected, and called, and
justified. Farewell, then, this vain sear, that there will be arr
end of all merita 11 free will be overtumed. For it is a proof
of extreme folly, to be terrified and to fly from that to which
the Scripture calls us. “lf,” says he, “thou didst receive it,
why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it? '’ (rr)
You see that he divests free will of every thing, with the ex·
press design 01 leaving uo room 101 merita. But yet, the benc·
ficence and liberality 01 God being inexhaustible and various,
those graces which he confers ou us, because he makes them
curs, he rewerds, just as if they were our own virtues.

111. They further allege what may appear to be horrowed
from Chrysostom, that if our will has not this ability 10 choosc
good or evil, the partakers 01 the same nature must be either
all evil or all good. And not very fer from this is the writer,
whoeverhe was, 01 tlrc treatise On the Calliugos tlte Gentiles,
which is circulated under the name 01 Ambrosc, when he
argues, that no mou would ever recede from the saith, unless
