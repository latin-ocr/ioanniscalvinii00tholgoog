by an imputation of righteousness; so that we, who arc un·
righteous in ourselves‚ are considered as righteous in Christ.
This is the doctrine preached by Paul in the thirteenth chapter
of the Acts: “ 'I'brough this man is preached unto you the
forgiveness of sins; and by him all that believe are justified
from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law
of Moses.'’ (t) We see that after remission of sins, this jus·
tifieation is mentioned, as if by way of explanation: we see
clearly that it means an acquitem, that it is separated from the
works of the law, that it is a mere favour of Christ3 that it is
apprehended by faith: we see, finally, the interposition of
a satisfaction, when he says that we are justified from sins by
Christ. Thus, when it is said, that the publican “went down
to his house justified‚”(u) we cannot say that he obtained
righteousness by any merit of works. The meaning therefore
is, that after he had obtained the pardon of his sins, he was
considered as righteous in the sight of God. He was righteous,
therefore, not through any approbation of his werke, but through
God's graeious absolution. Wherefore Ambrose beautifully
styles confession of sins, a legitimate justification.

lV. But leaving all contentiori about the term, if we attend
to the thing itself, as it is described to us, every doubt will be
removed. For Paul certainly describas justification as an ac·
ceptance, when he says to the Ephesians, “ God hath predesti-
nated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself,
according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the
glory of his grace, whereiu he hath made us accepted.'' (ro)
The meaning of this passage is the same as when in another
place we are said to be “justified freely by his grace.’' (a)
But in the fourth chapter to the Romans, he first mentions an
imputation of righteousness, and immediately represents it as
consisting in remissiori of sins. “ David,” says he, “describeth
the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth right·
eousness without works, saying‚ Blessed are they whose iniqui·
ties are forgiven,'’ dre. (y) He there, indeed, argues aot con·
cerning a branch, but the whole of justification. He also ad·
duces the definition of it given by David, when he pronounees
them to be blessed who receive the free forgiveness of their
sins; whence it appears, that this righteousness of which he ·
speaks is simply opposed to guilt. But the most decisive pas-
sage of all on this point, is where he teaches us that the grand
objectos the ministry of the gospel is, that we may “be re·
conciled to God,’' because he is pleased to receive us into liis
favour through Christ, “ not imputing ’³ our ‘⁴ trespasses unto ’¹
