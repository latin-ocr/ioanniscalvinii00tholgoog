111. Ilrnow, indeed, that they commonly cite the opinion
of Augustino, where he says, “that he would not believe the
Gospel unless he were influenced hy the authority of the
Church.'’ f p) But how falsely and unfairly this is cited in
support of such a notion, it is easy to discover from the con·
text. He was in that contending with the Manichees, who
wished to be credited‚ without any controversy, when they
affirmed the truth to beon their side, but never proved it.
Now, as they made the authority of the Gospel a pretext in
order to establish the credit of their Manicheus, he inquires
what they would do if they met with a man who did not be·
lieve the Gospel; with what kind of persuasion they would
convert him to their opinion He afterwards adds,“1,ndecd
1 would not give credit to the Gospel,” dcc, intending, that he’
himself, when an alien from the saith, could not be prevailed
on to embrace the Gospel as the certain truth of God, till he
was convinced by the authority of the Church. And is it sur·
prising that any one, yet destitute of the knowledge of Christ,
should pay a respect to men? Augustino, therefore, does not
there maintain that the saith of the pious is founded on the
authority of the Church, nor does he mean that the certainty
of the Gospel depends on it; but simply, that unbelievers
would have uo assurance of the truth of the Gospel, that
would win them to Christ, unless they were influenced by the
consent of the Church. And a little before, he clearly con·
firms it in these words: “When I shall have commended my
own crecd, and derided yours, what judgrnent, thinlr you,
ought we to form, what conduct ought we to pursue, but to
forsalre those who invite us to aclruowledge things that ars
certain, and afterwards command usto believe things that ara
uncertain; and to follow those who invite us first to believe
what we cannot yet clearly see, that, being strengthened by
faith, wc may acquire an understanding of what we believe3
our mind being now internally strengthened and illuminated,
not hymen, but by God himself? '’ These are the express
words of Augustine3 whence the inference is obvious to every
one, that this holy man did not design to suspend our saith in
the Scriptures on the arbitrary decision of the Church, but
only to show (what we all confess to be trua) that they who
