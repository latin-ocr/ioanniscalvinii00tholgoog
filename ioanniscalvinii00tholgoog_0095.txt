Maccabeos, to diminish the credit of the Scriptum, nothing
could be conceived more adapted to establish it. But first let us
divest it of their artificial colouring, and theu retort upon thern
the weapon which they direct against us. When Antiochus,
say they, commanded all the books to be burned, whence pro-
ceeded the copies which we now have? l, on the contrary,
inquire, where they could so speedily be fabricated. For
it is evident, that, as soon as the persecution subsided,
they immediately appeared, and were, without controversy,
acknowledged as the same by all pious men; who, having
been educated in their doctrine, had been familiarly ac-
quainted with thern. Nay, even when all the impiouS, as
if by a general conspiracy, so wantonly insultcd the Jews,
no man ever dared to charge thern with forging their books
Por, whatever be their opinion of the Jewish religion, yet they
confess that Moses was the author os it. What, then, do
these clamorous objectors, but betray their own consummate
impudence, when they slander, as supposititious, books whose
sacred antiquity is confirmed by the consent of all historica?
But, to waste no more useless labour in refuting such stale cal·
umnies, let us rather consider how carefully the Lord preserved
his own word, when, beyond all hope, he rescued it from tha
fury of the most cruel of tyrants, as from a devouring fire 3-
that he endued the pious priests aud others with so much con·
stancy, that they hesitated not to redeem this treasure, if ne·
cessary, with their lives, to transmit it to posterity3 and that he
frustrated the most diligent inquisition of so many govemors
and soldiers. Who is there but must acknowledge it to have
been an eminent and wonderful work of God, that those sacred
monuments, which the impious had flattered themselves were
utterly destroyed, were soon public again, as it were, sully re·
stored to mankind, and, indeed, with far greater honour? For
soon aster followed the Greek Translation, which published
them throughout the world. Nor was God's preserving the
tables of his covenant from the sanguinary edicts of Antiochus,
the only instance of his wonderful operation, but that, amidst
such various miserias, with which the Jewish nation was di·
minished arrd laid waste, and at last nearly exterminated, these
recorda still remained entire. The Hebrew language lay not
only despised, but almost unknown3 and surely, had not God
consulted the interest of religion, it had been totally lost. Por
how much the Jews, aster their return from captivity, departed
from the genuine use of their native language, appears srom thc
prophets of that age3 which it is therefore useful to observa,
because this comparison more clearly evinces the antiquity of
the law and the propheta. And by whom hath God preserved
to us the doctrine of salvatiou contained in the law aud the
