wrests to an erroneous meaning. NoW, 1 contend that both in
the words of the Prophet which l have cited, and in other
passages, these two things are clearly sIgnified‚ that the Lord
correcta our depraved will, or rather removes it, and of him·
sels introduces a good one in its place. As it is preceded by
grace, Ι allow you to style it an attendant3 but sInce its re·
formation is the work 01 the Lord, it is wrong to attribute to
man a voluntary obediencc in following the grridance of grace.
Therefore it is not a proper expression of chrysostom, that
graccis able to effect nothing without the will, nor the will
without grace, as if grace did not produce the will itself, as
we have just seen from Paul. Nor was it the intention of
Augustino, when he called the human will the companion of
grace, to assign to it any secondary office next to grace in the
good work; but with a view to refute the nefarious dogma
broached by Pelagius, who made the· prIme cause of salvation
to consist in human merit, he contende, what was sufficient for
lits present argument, that grace is prior to all merit; omitting,
at this time, the other question concerning the perpetual effi·
ciency 01 grace, which is admirably treated by him on other
occasions. F'or when he frequently sayS, that the Lord pre·
cedes the unwilling that he may will, and follows the willing
that he may not will in vain, he makes him the sole author 01
the good work. His language on this subject is too explicit to
require much argument. ‘¹ Men labour,” says he, “ to discover
in our will something that is our own, and not derived from
God, and how any such discovery can be made, Ι know netl’
In his first book against Pelagius and Celestius, where he ex·
plains that declaration 01 Christ, “ Every man that hath heard
01 the Father cometh unto me,” (n) he sayS, that ‘¹ the will is
assisted so as to enable it not only to know its duty, but what
it knows, also to do.” And thus when God tenches not by the
letter 01 the law, but by the grace of thc Spirit, he teaches
in such a manner, that whatever each one has learned, he
not only sees in knowing it, but desires in willing, and per·
forms in doing.

VIII. And as we are now engaged on the principal point of
the argument, let us give the reader a summary os the doctrIne,
and prove it by a few very clear testimonies of Scripture; and
then, that no one may accuse us of perverting the Scriptura,
let us also show that the trnth which we assert to be deduced
from the Scripture is not destitute of the support of this holy
nran; I mean Angustine. For Ι conceive it is unnecessary to
recite in regular order all the passages which might be adduced
from the Scriptures in confirmation ot' our opinion; provided
