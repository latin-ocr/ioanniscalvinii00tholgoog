know what was declared to them to be true3 that it was an
abominable sacrilege to transferte God the guilt of their crimes,
which belonged solely to themselves. With these few solu·
tiens, we may very easily despatch the immense multitude of
testimonies, which the enemies of the grace of God are accus·
tomed to collect, both from the precepts of the law, and from
the expostulations directed to transgressore of it, in order to es·
tablish the idol of free will. In one psalm the Jews are stigma·
tired as “astubborn and rebellione generatim, ageneration that
set not their heart aright.” (s) In another, the Psalmist exhorts
the men of his age to “ harden not their hearts ; ’' (t) which im·
plies, that all the guilt of rebellion lies in the perverseness of
men. But it is absurd to infer from this passage that the heart
'rs equally flexible to either side3 whereas “the preparation ’²
of it is “ from the Lord.” (c) The Psalmist says, “I have in·
clined my heart to perform thy statutas ; ’' (w) because he had
devoted himself to the service of God without any reluctance,
but with a cheerful readiness of mind. Yet he boasts not of
being himself the author of this inclination, which in the same
psalm he acknowledges to be the gist of God. (s) We should
remember‚ therefore, the admonition of Paul, when he commende
the faithful to “work out ’² their “own salvation with fear and
trembling3 for it is God which worketh in” them “both to
will and to do.’' (y) He assigna them a part to perform, that
they may not indulge themselves in carnal negligenee; but by
inculcating “sear and trembling,” he humbles thern, and re-
minds them that this very thing, which they are commanded
to do, is the peculiar work of God. ln this he plainly suggests
that the faithful act, if l may be allowed the expression, pas·
sively, inasmuch as they arc fmnished with strength from
heaven, that they may arrogate nothing at all to themselves.
Wheresore, when Peter exhorts us to “edd to '’ our “ saith, vir-
tue,’' (z) he does not allot us an under part to be performed, as
though we could do any thing seperately, of ourselves; he
only arouses the indolence of the flesh, by which faith itself is
frequently extinguished. To the same purpose is the exhorta·
tion of Paul: “Quench not the Spirit;’' (a) sor slothfulness
gradually prevails over the faithful, unless it be corrected. But
if any one should infer from this, that it is at his own option to
cherish the light offered him, his ignorance will easily be resn-
ted; since this diligence which Paul requires, proceeds only
from God. For we are also frequently commanded to “ cleanse
ourselves from all filthiness,” (b) whilst the Spirit claime the
office of sanctisying us exclusively to himself. ln short, that
