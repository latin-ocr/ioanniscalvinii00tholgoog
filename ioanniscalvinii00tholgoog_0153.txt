because it contribules something of its own. For the meaning
of Christ is clearly that we are as a dry and worthless log,
when separated from him ; because, independently of him, we
baveno ability to do good, as he says also in another place:
“ Every plant, which my heavenly Father has nol planted,
shall be rooted up.'’ (v) Wherefore the Apostle ascribes all the
praise to himin the place already cited. “ lt is God,'' says he,
“which worketh in you both to will aud to do.'' (w) The
first part of a good work is volition, the next an effectual en·
deavour to perform it ; God is the author of both. 'I'herefore
we rob the Lord‚ if we arrogata any thing to ourselves either in
volition or in execution. If God were said to assist the in·
firmity of our will, then there would be something lest to us,
but since he is said to produce the will, all the good that is in
it, is placed without us. And because the good will is still op·
pressed by the burden of our flesh, so that it cannot extricate
itself, he has added, that in struggling with the difficulties of
that conflict, we are supplied with constaney of exertion to
carry ‘'ff-wlitffns lilntoleffeclp¹ For ithenrvriae‘ there vplould be

which reason David, after having prayed that the way of God
may be discovered to him, that he may walk in his truth, im·
mediately adds, “Unite my beart to fear thy narne.’'(y) ln
these words he intimatas, that even good men are subject to so
many distractione of mind, that they soon wander and fall, un·
less they are strengthened to persevera. For the same reason,
itr another passage, having prayed that his steps might be
ordered in the word of the Lord‚ he likewise implores strength
for a warfare: “Lat not any iniquity have dominion over
me.'’ l z) ln this manner, therefore, the Lord both begins and
completes the good work in us ; that it may be owing to him,
that the will conceives a love for what is right, that it is in-
clined to desire it, and is excited and impelled to endeavour to
attain it; and then that the choica, desire, and endeavour do

maintained and believed for many ages, in such a manner that
it would afterwards be at our option either to obey the im·
pulse or to resist it, but hyan efficacious influence. The
