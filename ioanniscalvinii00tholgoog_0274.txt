of the New Testament, that they enjoyed an exception from
the common law of the' Old Testament, and were exempted
from those evils. Resides, we shall deny that they were fa·
voured with the spirit of liberty end security, to such a degree
aa not to experience from the law some measure both of fear
and of servitude. For notwithstanding their enjoyment of that
privilege, which they obtained by the grace of the gospel, yet
they were subject to the same observances and burdens as the
people in general. As they were obliged, therefore, to a diligent
observance of these ceremonias, which were emblems of the state
of pupilage similar to bondage, and the hand-writing, by which
they confessed themselves guilty of sin, did not release thern
from the obligation, they may justly be said, in comparison
with us, to heve been under a testament of bondage eud fear,
when we consider the common mode of procedure which the
Lord theu pursued with the Israelitish nation.

When Augustine denied that they ought to be considered as
part of the Old Testameut, he gave a very proper opinion, and
intended the same that we now resch, for he had in view those
passages of Jeramiah and Paul, in which the Old Testament is
distinguished from the word of grace and mercy. He very
judiciously adds also in the same place, that the children of the
promise, from the beginning of the world, who have been re·
generated by God, and, un'der the influence of faith working by
love, have obeyed his commende, belong to the Now Testa·

believing in the Mediator, through whom they doubted not that
the Spirit was dispensed to thern to enable thern to do their
duty, and that whenever they sinned they were pardoned.
For this is the very same thing which l meant to essert : Thet

Scriptura mentions as having been peculiarly chosen by God,

salvation. Between our distinction and that of Augustino
there is this difference -that ours (according to this declaration
of Ohrist, “the law and the prophete were until John; since
that time the kingdom of God is preached ; ”)(i) distinguishes
between the clearness of the gospel and the more obscure dis·
