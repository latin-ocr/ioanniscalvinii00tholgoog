vation. Both of them, as they contrast the Old and New Τοι-
tarnents with each other, consider nothing in the laW, but what
properly belongs to it. For example, the law contains ire·
lltltnlt‘lnh,ltssthlt{illati tulllius?
when the mere nature os the law is the subject os discussion
All that they attribute to it is, that it enjoins what isright, and
prohibita crimes; that it proclaims a reward sor the followers
os righteousness, and denounces punishments against transgres-
sors 5 but that it neither changes nor corrects the depravity os
heart which is natural to all men.

VIII. Now, let us explain the comparisonot' the apostle in
all its branches. ln the first place, the Old Testament is lite·
rel, because it was promulgated without the efficacy os the
Spirit3 the New is spiritual, because the Lord has engraven
it in a spiritual manner on the hearts of men. The second
contrast,‘therefore, serves asan elucidation os the first. The
Old Testament is the revelation ol death, because it can only
involve all mankind in a curse; the New is the instrument os
life, because it delivers us from the emsa, and restores us to
favour with God The formeris the ministry os condemna·
tion, because it convicta all the children of Adam os unright·
eousness3 the latter is the ministry os righteonsness‚ because it
reveals the mercy os God, by which we are made righteous.
'Phe last contrast must be referred to the legal ceremonias.
'Phe law having an image os things that were at a distance, it
was necessary that in time it should be abolished and disap-
psar. The gospel‚ exhibiting the body itself, retains a firm
and perpetual stability. Jeremiah calls even the moral law a
weak and srail covenant, but lor another reason3 namely,-be·
cause it was soon broken by the sudden defection os an un·
grateful people. But as such aviolation arises from the fault
os the people‚ it cannot be properly attributed to the Testarnent.
The ceremonias, however, which at the advent os Christ were
abolished by their own weakness, contained in themselves the
cause of their abrogation. Now, this difference between the .
“letter'' and the “spirit'' is not to be understood as if the
Lord had given his law to the Jews without any beneficial re·
sult, without one os theru being converted to him; but it is
used in a way of comparison, to display the plenitude of grace
with which the same legislator, assuming as it were a new
character, has honoured the preaohing os the gospel. For if
we survey the multitude of those, from among all natione,
whom, by the influence of his Spirit in tha preaching of the
gospel‚ the Lord has regenerated and gathered into commu·
nion with his Olnrrch, we shall say that those of the ancient
Israelites, who cordially and sincerely embraced the covenant
