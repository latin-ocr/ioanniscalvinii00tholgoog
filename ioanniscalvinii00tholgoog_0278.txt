beginning. By changing tha external form and mode, he has
discovered no mutability in himself, but has sofar accommo-
dated himself to the capacity 01111011, which is various and
mutabis.

XIV. But they inquire whence this diversity proceeded,
except from the will of God. Could 110 not, as well from the
beginning as since the advent of Christ, give a revelation of
eternal life in clear language without any figures, instruct his
peopla by a few plain sacramenta, bestow his Holy Spirit, and
diffuse his grace through all the world? This is just the same
as if they were to quarrel with God, because he created the
world at so late a period, whereas 110 might have done it be·
fore3 or because he has appointed the alternate vicissitudes
of summer and winter, of day and night. But let us not doubt
what ought to be believed by 011 pious men, that whatever ia
dona by God is dona wisely and righteously3 although we
frequently know nothing 01 tha causes which render such
amsactions necessary. For it would be arrogating too much
to ourselves, not to permit God to keep the reasons of his de-
crees concealed from ua. But it is surprising‚ say they, that
he now rejects and abominatas the sacrifices of cattle, and all
tha apparatus of the Levitical priesthood, with which ha used
to be delighted3 as though truly these external aud transi·
tory things could afford pleasure to God, or affect him in any
way whatever. It has already been observed, that he did
none 01 these things on his own account, but appointed them
all 101 the salvationes 111011. 11 0 physician cure a young man
01 any disease by a very excellent method, aud afterwards
adopt a different mode 01 01110 with the same person when ad·
vanced in years, shall we therefore say that he rejects the
method 01 cure which he before approved? We will rather
say, that he perseveras in the same system, and considers the
difference 01 age. Thus it was necessary, before the appear-
ance 01 Christ, that he should be prefigured‚ and his future
advent announced by one kind 01 emblems3 since he hasbeen
manifested, it is right that 110 should be represented by others.
But with respect to the Divina vocatiou, now more widely ex·
tended among all nations since the advent of Christ than it
was before, and with regard to the 111010 copious allusion 01 the
greces of the Spirit, who can deny, that it is reasonable and
just 101 God to retain under his own power and will the free
dispensation 01 his favours; that he may illuminate what na·
tions he pleases; that wherevcr he pleases hc may introduce
the preachiug 01 his word, that he may give to his instruction
whatever kind and degree of profit and success he pleases; that

wherevcr he pleases, in any age, 110 may punish the ingratitude
01 the world by depriving them of the knowledge of his name,
