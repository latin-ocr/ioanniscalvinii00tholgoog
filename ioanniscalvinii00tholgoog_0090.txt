multitudes have been miserably deceived, aud has often used
obsoleta forms of speech as a maslr to conceal his imposturas.
But tho vanity and fraud of such affectation ara visible to all
menos moderate understanding. With respect to the sacred
Scriptura, though presumptuous men try to cavil at various
passages, yet it is evidently replete with sentences which ara
beyond the powers of human conception. Let all the propheta
be examined3 not one will be found, who has not far surpassed
the ability of men; so that those to whom their doctriueis
insipid must be accounted utterly destitute of all true taste.

111. This argument has been copiously treated by other
writers ; wherefore it may suffice at present merely to hint at
afew things which chiefly relate to the subject in a general
view. Beside what I have already treated on, the antiquity
of the Scriptura is of no small weight. For, notwithstanding
the fabulous accounts of the Greek writers concerning the
Egyptian theology, yet there remeius no monument of any
religion, but what is much lower than the age of Moses. Nor
does Moses invent anew deity; he only nraltes a declaration
of what the israelites had, through along series of years, re·
ceived by tradition from their forefathers concerning the eternal
God. For what does he aim at, but to recall them to the
covenant made with Abraham? lf he had advanced a thing
till then unheard of, it would not have been received3 but
their liberation from the servitude in which they were detained
must have been a thing well known to them all; so that the
mention of it immediately excited universal attention. lt is
probable also that they had been informed of the number of
four hundred years. Now, we must consider, if Moses (who
himself preceded all other writers by such a long distance of
time) derives the tradition of his doctrine from so remote a
beginning, how much thc sacred Scriptura cxceeds in antiquity
all other boolts.

IV. Unless any would choosc to credit the Egyptians, who
extend their antiquity to six thousand years before the creation
of the world. But since their garrulity has been ridiculed
even by all the profane writers, l need not trouble myself
with refuting it. Josephus, in his book against Appion‚ cites
from tho most ancient writers testimonies worthy of being re·
membered3 whence we may gather, that the doctrine contained
in the law has, according to the consent of all nations, been
renowncd from the remotest ages, although it was neither read
nor truly understood. Now, that the malicious might have no
room for suspicion, nor even the wiched any pretence for
cavilling, God hath provided the most excellent remedies for
both these dangers. When Moses relatas what Jacob had,

almost three hrmdred years before, by the spirit of inspiratiou
