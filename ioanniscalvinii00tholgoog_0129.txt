relation, (or campartem) here, because, when mention is made
simply and indefinitely of God, this name pertains uo less to
the Son and spirit, than to the Father. But wheuerer the
Father is compared with the Son, the property peculiar to
each distinguishes him from the other. Thirdly, whatever
is proper to each of them, 1 essert to be incommunicable, be·
cause whatever is ascribed to the Father as a character of
distinction, cannot be applied or transferred to the Son. Nor,
indeed, do 1 disapprove of the definition of Tertullian, if rightly
understood: “That there is iu God a certain distribution or

Deity of the Son and of the Holy Spirit; after which we
shall see how they differ from each other. When the Scrip-
tura speaks of tlte Word es God, it certainly were very absurd
to imagine it to be only a transient and momentary sound,
omitted into the air, and coming forth from God himself ; of
which nature were the oracles, given to the fathers, and all
the propheciae. It is rather to be understood of the cterual
wisdom residing in God, whence the eracles, and all the
propheciae, proceedcd. For, according to the testimony of
Peter, (m) the ancient Prophets spake by the Spirit of Christ
uo less than the Apostles and all the succeeding ministers of
the heavcnly doctrine. But, as Christ had not yet been man·
ifested, we must necessarily understand that the Word was
begotten of the Father before the world began. And if the
Spirit that inspired the Propheta was the Spirit of the Word,
we conclude, beyond all doubt, that the W ord was truly God.
And this is taught by Moses, with sufficient perspicuity, in the
creation of the world, iu which he represents the Word as
acting such a conspicuous part. For why does he relate that
God, in the creation of each of his works, said, Let this or that
be done, but that the anscarchable glory of God may resplen-
dently appear iu his image? Captious and'loquacious men
would readily evade this argument, hy saying, that the Word
imports au order or command; but the Apostles are better in·
terpretere, who declara, that the worlds were created hy the
Son, and that he “upholds all things by the word of his
power.” (ra) For here we see that the Word intends the n'od
or mandate of the Son, who is himself the eternal aud esseutial
Son os the Father. Nor, to the wisc and sober, is there any
obscurity in that passage of Solamen, where he introduces
Wisdom us begotteu of the Father before time began, and pre·
siding at the creation of the world, and over all the works os
God. Por, to pretend that this denotes some temporary ex·
