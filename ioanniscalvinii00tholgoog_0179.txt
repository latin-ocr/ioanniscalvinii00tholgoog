fore nothing is inore certain, than that Moses in these words
comprehended the covenant of mercy, which he had promul·
gated together with the precepts of the law. For in a pre·
ceding versa he had taught that our hearts must be circumcised
by God, in order that we may love him. (lc) 'Phercfore he
placed this facility, of which hc afterwards speaks, notin the
strength of man, butiri the assistance and protection of the
Holy SpIrit, who powerfully accomplishes his work in our in·
firmity. However, the passage is not to be understood simply
of the precepta, but rather of the promises of the gospel, which
are sofar from maintaining an ability in us to obtain righteous·
ness, that they prove us to be utterly destitute of it. Paul,
considering the same, proves by this testimony that salvation
· is proposed to us in the gospel, not under that hard, difficult,
und impossible condition, prescribed to us in the law, which
pronounces it attainable only by those who have fullilled all
the commandments, but undere condition easily and readily to
be performed. Therefore this testimony contributes nothing
to support the liberty of the human will.

XIII. Some other passages also are frequently objected,
which show that God sometimes tries men by withdrawing
the assistance of his grace, and waits to see what course they
will pursue3 as in Hosea: “I will go and return to my place,
till they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face.” (l) 1t
Ι would be ridiculous, they say, for the Lord to consider, whether
Israel would seek his face, unless their minds were flexible,
capable of iuclining either way, according to their own pleasure;
asif it were not very common for God, in the Prophets, to
represent himself as despising and rejecting his people, till they
should amend their lives. But what will our adversaries infer
from such threats? If they maintain, that those who are de·
serted by God, are capable of converting themselves, they

their controversy with us? But they will reply, that they
concede its necessity in such a sense as to maintain that man
still retains some power, How do they prove it? Certainly
not from this or any similar passages. For it isone thing to
dcpnrt from a man, to observc what he will do when sorsaken
and left to himself, and another to assist his little strength in
proportion to his imbecility. What, then, it will be inquircd,
is implied in such forms of expression? Ireply, that the im·
portos thern is just as it God had said, Since admonitions, ex·
hortations, and reproofS, produce no good effect on this rebellious
people, I will withdraw myself for a little while, and silently
