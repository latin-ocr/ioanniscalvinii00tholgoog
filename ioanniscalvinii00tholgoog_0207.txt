in the remissiori of sins, by which we are released from the
rigour of the law. He tcaches us, therefore, that we must be
released from thc bondage of the law, unless we would perish
in misery under it. But what bondage? the bondage of that
austere and rigid exactiori, which remits nothing from its
strictest requirements, and permits no transgression to pass
with impunity; isay, Christ, in order to redeem us from this
curse, was “made a curse for us. For it is written, Cursed
is every onc that hangeth on atree.” (w) ln the following
chapter, indeed, he tells us, that Christ was “made under the
laW, to redeem them that were under the law; '' but in the
same sense3 for he immediately adds, “that we might receive
thc adoption of sons.'’(c) What is this? that we might not
be oppressed with a perpetual servitude, which would keep our
consciences in continual distress with the dread of death. At
the sarne time this truth remains for ever unshaken, that the
law has sustained no diminution of its authority, but ought
always to receive from us the same veneration and obediencc.

XVI. The case of ceremonies, which have been abrogated,
not as to their effect, but only as to their use, is very different.
Their having been abolished by the advent of Christ, is so far
from derogating from their sanctity‚ that it rather recommends
and rendere it more illustrious. For as they must have ex-
hibitcd to the people, in ancient times, a vain spectacla, unless
they had discovered the virtue of the death and resurrection
of Christ, so, if they had not ccased, we should, in the present
age, have been unable to discern for what purpose they were
instituted. To prove, therefore, that the observance of thern
is not only needless, but even injurians, Paul teaches us that
they were shadows, the body of which we lrave in Christ. (y)
We see, then, that the truth shines with greater splendour in
their abolition, than if they still continued to give a distant
and obscure representation of Christ, who has openly appeared.
For this reason, at the death of Christ, “the veil of the temple
was rent in twain from tlte top to the bottom;’' (z) because,
according to the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, the liv·
ing and express image cf the heavenly blessings, which before
had been only sketched in obscure lineaments, was now clearly
revealed. The same trnth is conveyed in the declaration of
Christ, that “the law and the prophets were until John; since

that tirne the kingdom of God is preached.” (a) Not that the
holy fathers had been destitute of that preaching which con·
tains the hope of salvation, and of eternal life, but because
they saw only at a distance, and under shadows, what we now
contemplate in open day. But the reason, why it was neces-
