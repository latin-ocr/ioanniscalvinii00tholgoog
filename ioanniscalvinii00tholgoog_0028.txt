allega that it has long ago been condemned by the general
consent, aud suppressed by many judicia] decisione, this will
be only equivalent to saying, that it has been sometimes
violently rejected through the influence and power ol its ad·
versaries, and sometimes insidiously and fraudulently op-
pressed by falsehoods, artifices, and calumnias. Violence is
displayed, when sanguinary sentences are passed against it
without the cause being heard3 and fraud, when it is un·
justly accused of sedition and mischief. Lest any one should
suppose that these our complaints are unsounded, you yourseli,
Sire, can bear witness of the salse calumnies with which you

sufficient prooss. Convicted of what crime? Os this con·
demned doctrine, they say. But with what justice is it con·
demnedl Now, the ground os delence was not to abjure the
doctrine itsels, but to maintain its truth. On this subject,
however, not a word is allowed to be uttered.

Wheresore I beseech you, Sira, —and surely it is not an un·
reasonable request,-to take upon yoursels the entire eogniaance
of this cause, which has hitherto been confusedly and care·
lessly agitated, without any order ol law, and with outrageous
passion rather than judicia] gravity. Think not that I am
