to say that there are three subswaoas in God. Yet, that there
are three substomes in God, you will find assened in Hilnry
more than a hundred times. But how perplexed isJerome
on the word hypostasis! For he suspects some latent poison
in the assenion, that there are three hypostases in God, And
if arsy one uses this word in a pious sense, he refrains not from
calling it an improper expression; if, indeed, he was sincere
iu this declaration, and did not rather kuowingly and wiliully
endeavour to asperae, with a groundless calrimny, the bishops
of the East, whom he hated. Ha certainly discovers not much
iugenuonsness in affirming that, in all the profane schools,
sivla (essence) is the same as ὑπόστασις, (hypostasis,) which the
trite and common nse of the words universally contradicts.
More modesty and liberality are discovered by Angustiae,
who, though he asseris that the word hypostasis, in this sense,
is new to Latin ears, yet leaves the'Greelrs their usual phra-
seology, and even peaceably toleratas the Latine, who had im·
itated their language3 and the account of Socrates, in the
sixth book of his Tripartite History, seems to imply, that it was
by ignorant meu that it hadhrst been improperly applied to this
subject. The same Hilary accuses the heretics ofa great
crime, in constraining him, by their wickedness, to expose to
the danger of human language those things which ought to
be confined within the religion of the mind; plainly avowing
that this is to do thingsunlawful, to express things inexpressible,
to assume things not concaded. A little after, he largely ex·
cuses himself for his boldness in bringing forward new terms;
lor, when he has used the names of nature, Father, Son, and
Spirit, he immediately adds, that whatever is songht further,
isbeyond the signification of language, beyond the reach of
our censes, beyond the conception of our understanding. And,
in another place, he pronounces that happy were the bishops
ol Gaul, who had neither composed, nor received, nor even
known, any other confession but that ancient and very simple
one, which had been received in all tho churches from the
days of the Apostles. Very similar is the excuse of Augustino,
that this word was extorted by necessity, on account of the
poverty of human langnage on so great a subject, not for the
sake of expressing what God is, but to avoid passing it over
in total silence, that the Father, Son, and Spirit are three.
This moderationes those holy men should teach us, not to
pass such severe censuros on those who are unwilling to sub·
scribe to expressions adopted by us, provided they are not
actuated by pride, perverseness, or disingenuous subtlety. But
let them also, on the other hand, consider the great necessity
which constrains us to use such language, that, by degrees,
they may at length bc accustomed to a usefnl phraseology.
