and healed. For since the Lord, in the assistance which be
aliords us, besmws on us that which we need, an exhibition os
the nature os his work in us will immediately discover the na·
ture of our necessity. When the Apostle tells the Philippians,
that he is “confident that he which bath began a good work
in them will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ; ’³ (a) by
the beginning oi a good work he undoubtedly designs the com-
mencement of conversion, which takes place in the will. There·
fore God begins the good work in us by exciting in our hearts
alove, desire, and ardent pursuit of righteousness; or, to speak
more properly, by bending, fonniug, and directing our bearts
towards righteousness; but he completas it, by confirming us to
perseveranee. Tha't 110 one may cavil, that the good work is
begun by the Lord, inasmuch as the will, which is weak of
itsels, is assisted by him, tbe Spirit declares in another place
how sar the ability of the will reaches, when left to itsels. “A
new beart also,’' says be, “will I give you, and a new spirit
will Iput within you; and lwill take away the stony beart
out of your ssesh, and I will give you a beart ol flesh. And 1
will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
statutas.” (f ) Who will assert that the infirmity os tbe human
will is only strengthened by assistance, to enable it efficaciously
to aspire to tbe choice of that which is good, when it actually
needs a toral transformation and renovationi li there be in a
stone any softness, which, by some application, being made more
tender, would be flexible in every direction, then 1 will not
deny the flexibility of the human beart to the obedience of rec·
titude, provided its imperfectioris are supplied by the graccos
God. But if, by this similitude, the Lord intended to show
that no good will ever be extracted from our hearts, unless they
are entirely renewed, let us not divide between him and us,
what he claims exclusively to himself. If, therefore, when
God converts us to the pursrrit of rectitude, this change is like
the transformation of a stone into flesh, it sollows, that what·
ever belongs to our own will is removed, and what succeeds to
it is entirely srom God. The will, l say, is removed, not con·
sidered as the will, because, in the conversion os man, tha
properties of our original nature remain entire. lassert also,
that it is created anew, not that the will then begins to exist,
but that it is then converted from an evil into a good one.
This l affirm to be done entirely by God, because, according to
the testimony of the same Apostle, “ we are not sufficient ”
even “to think.” (g) Theresore he elsewhere declares, not

merely that God assists the infirmity os our will, or correcta its
depravity, but that he “worketh iu us to will.’' (Ιι) Wh'ence
