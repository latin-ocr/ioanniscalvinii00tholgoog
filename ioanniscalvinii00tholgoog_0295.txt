we entirely lose all confidence in ourselves3 we shall never
find sufficient encouragement in him, unless we are previously
dejected in ourselves; we shall never enjoy sufficient consola-
tion in him, unless we are utterly disconsolate in ourselves.
We are prepared, therefore, to seek and obtain the grece of God,
discerding at the same time all confidence in ourselves, and ra·
lying solely on the essnrance of his mercy, “ when,'' as Augus-
tine says, ‘¹ forgetting our own merits, we embraca the free gifts
of Christ; because, if he sought merits in us, we should not
come to his free gifts.” With him Bernard fully agrees, when
he compares proud men, that arrogate ever so little to their own
merits, to unfaithful servants, because they unjustly claim the
praise of the grace which passos through them, just as though
a wall should say that it produces the sunbeams which it re-
ceives through a window. But not to dwell any longer on
this, we may lay it down asa brief, but general and certain
maxim, thet heis prepared for a participation of the benefits
of Divine mercy, who has wholly divested himself, Iwill not
sey of his righteousness, which is a mere nullity, but of the
vein and airy phantom of righteousness; for as far as any man
is satisfied with himself, so far ha reises an impediment to the
exercise of the grece of God.

Herus are two things to which we must always be particu-
larly attentive; to maintain the glory of the Lord nnimpuircd
and undiminished, and to preserve in our own consciencesa
placid composurc and serene tranquillity with regard to the
Divine jndgment. We see how frequently and solicitously tha
Scripture exhorts us to render ascriptione of praise to God alone,
when it treats of justification. And, indeed, the apostle assures
us that the design of the Lord in conferring righteousness upon
usin Christ, is to manifest his own righteousness. The nature
of that manifestation he immediately snbjoins: it is, “that he
might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in
Jesus.''(u) The righteonsness of God, we see, is not suffl-
ciently illustrious, unless he alone be esteemed righteous, and
communicate the grace of justification to the unworthy. For
this reason it is his will “that every mouth be stopped, and all
