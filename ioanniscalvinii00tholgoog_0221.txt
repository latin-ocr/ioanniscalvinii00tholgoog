name Lean, or Jrnovrrr, designatas his authority and legiti-
mate dominion. For if all things be of him, and if in him all
things consist, it is reasonable that all things be referred to
him, agreeably to tho observation of Paul. (o) 'Pherefore by
this word alone we are brought into complete subjection to the
power of the Divina majesty3 for it would be monstrous for us
to desire to remove ourselves from his jurisdiction, out of
whom we cannot exist.

XIV. After having shown that he has a right to command,
and that obedienee is his just due, —that he may not appear to
constrain us by necessity alone, he sweetly allures us by pro·
nouncing himself the God of the Ohureh. For the expression
implies the mutual relation which is contained in that pro·
mise, “ 1 will be their God, and they shall be my people.'' (p)
Whence Christ proves the immortality of Abraham, Isaac, and

reeently experienced, but which, on account of its magnitude
and concomitant miracles, being worthy of everlasting remem-
branoe, might also have an influence on succeeding generations.
Resides, it was particularly suitable to the present occasion,
when the law was about to be published3 for the Lord sug·
gests that they were liberated from a miserable slavery in order
that they might. serve the author of their liberty with a prompt·

himself by certain epithets, by which he discriminatos his sa-
