, cellences3 which, it is no disparagement of that cause to

admit, were likewise accompanied by peculiar failings. lt
is not the design of this preface to portray and discriminate
their respective characters. They alike devoted their lives
and labours to rescue Christianity from the absurdities,
superstitione, and vices by which it had been so deplorably
deformed, mutilated, and obscured, and to recall the atten-
tion of mankind from tho doubtful traditions of men to the
uuerring word of God. But while they were all distin·
guished Reformers, Calvin has been generally acknowledged
to have been the most eminent theologian of the three.

Such was the superiority of the taleuts and attainments
of Calvio to those of most other great men, that the strictest
truth is in danger of being taken for exaggeration. lt is
impossible for any candid and intelligent person to have
even a slight acquaintance with his writings, without ad·
miring his various knowledge, extensive learning, profound
penetration, solid judgment, acute reasoning, pure morality,
aud fervent picty.

His Counnrvmnrss on the Scriptures have been cele·
brated for a juster method of exposition than had been
exhibited by any preceding writer. Above a hundred
years after his death, Poole, the author of the Synopsis, in
the preface to that valuable work, says, “ Calvin's Com·
mentaries abound in solid discussionsof theological subjects,
aud practical improvements of them. Subsequent writers
have borrowed most of their materials from Calvin,and his
interpretations adom the books even of those who repay the
obligatior by reproaching their master.” And nothingcan
more satisfactorily evince the high estimation to which they
are still entitled from the biblical student, than the follow-
ing testimony, given, after the lapse of another century, by
the late learned Bishop Horsley: “l hold the memory of
Calvin in high veneration: his works have a place in my
library3 and in the study of the Holy Scriptures, he isone
of the commentators whom 1 frequently consult.’'
