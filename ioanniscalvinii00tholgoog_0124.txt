though Christ, like wax impressed with a seal, represented in
himself the substance of the Father,) were not only harsh, but
also absurd. For the essence of God being simple and indivisi·
ble, he who contains all ιιι himself, notin part, or by derivatim,
but ιιι complete perfection, could not, without impropriety,
aad even absurdity, be called the express imago of rt But since
the Father ,although distinguished by his own peculiar ptbperty,
hath expressed himself entirely ιιι his Son, itis with the great-
est reason asserted that he hath made his hypostasis conspic-
uous in him, with which the other appellation, given him ιιι
the same passage, of‘ ‘the brightness of his glory,’' exactly
corresponds. From the words of the Apostle, we certainly
conclude, that there is in the Father a proper hypostasis, which
is conspicuous in the Son. And thence also we easily infer
the hypostasis of the Son, which distinguishes him from the
Father. The same reasoning is applicable to the Holy spirit,
for we shall soon prove him also to be God3 and yet he must,
of necessity, be considered as distinct from the Father. But
this is not a distinction of theomenes, which it is unlawful to
representas any other than simple and undivided lt follows,
therefore, if the testimony of the Apostle be credited, that thero
are in God three hypostases. And, as the Latius have ex·
pressed the same thing by the word person, it is too fastidious
and obstinate to contend about so clear a matter. If we wish
to translate word for word, we may call rt meditamentum,
in the same sense, have called it substance. Nor has the word
person been used by the Latins only; but the Greeks also, for
thc sake of testifying their consent to this doctrine, taught the
existence of three spaama(persons)in God. But both Greeks
and Latins, notwithstanding any verbal differenoe, are in perfect
harmony respecting the doctrine itself.

Ill. Now, though heretics rail at the word person, or some
morose and obstinate men clamorously refuse to admit a name
of human invention3 since they cannot make us assert that
there are three, each of whom is entirely God, nor yet that
there are more gods than one, how very unreasonable is it to
reprobate words which express nothing but what is testified and
recorded in the Scriptures! It were better, say they, to restrain
not only our thoughts, but our expressions also, within the
limits of the Scriptura, than to introduce exotic words, which
may generate future dissensions and disputes; for thus we
weary ourselves with verbal controversies; thus the truth is
lost in altercation; thus charity expires in odious contention.
If they call every word exotic, which cannot be found in the
Scripturas in so many syllables, they impose on us a law which
is very unreasonable, and which condemns all interpretation,
but what is composed of detached texts of Scripture connected
