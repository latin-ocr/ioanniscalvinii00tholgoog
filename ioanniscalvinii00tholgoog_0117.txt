immediately falling into idolatrous worship. But, even is the
danger were lese, yet, when l consider the use sor which tem
ples were designed, it appears tome extremely unworthy os
their sanctity, to receive any other imagcs, than those natural
aud expressive ones, which the Lord hath consecrated iu his
word; lmean Baptism, and the Supper os the Lord, and the
other ceremonies, with which our eyes ought to be more at·
tentively engaged, and more sensibly affected, than to require
any others formed by burnan ingenuity. Behold the incom-
parable advantages os imagcs! the loss of which, it you believe
the papists, nothing can compensate.

XlV. The remarks already made on this subject, 1 think,
would bc sufficient, it it were not necessary to take some
notice of the Oouncil of Nice; not that very celebrated one,
which was convened by Constantine the Great, but that which
was held about eight hundred years ago, hy the command,
and under the auspices, ol the Empress Irene. For that
Council decreed, not only that imagcs should be had in
churches, but also that they should be worshipped. And,
notwithstanding what l have advanced, the authority oi the

written in refutationes this practice, under the name os Char-
lemagne; which, from the diction, we may conclude was com·

Easteru churches, said, “ God created man in his own image ; '’
aud hence he inserted that we ought to have images. The
same prelata thought that images were recommended to us by
this sentence: “ Show me thy face, for it is glorious.’' Au·
other, to prove that they ought to be placed ou the altars,
cited this testimony: “No man lighteth a caudle, aud putteth
it under a bushel.’' Another, to show the contemplation ol‘·
these to be uselul to us, adduced a verse from a Psalm ε “ The
light os thy countenance, Ο Lord, is scaled upon us.’' Another
pressed this comparison into his service: “As the patriarchs
used the sacrifices ol the heathen, so Christiane ought to have
the imagcs oi saints, instead oi the idols ot' the heatheu.’'
Iu the same manner they tortured that expression, “Lord,l
have lovod the beauty os thy house.” But the most ingenious
