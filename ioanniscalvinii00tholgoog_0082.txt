his temple doth every one speak os his glory; ’² because unbe-
lievers are deal to all the voices os God, which resouud in the
air. So, in another Psalm, after describing the terrible waves
ol' the sea, he concludes thus: “Thy testimonies are very sure:
holiness becometh tlrine house, Ο Lord, for ever.” (m) Hence
also proceeds the observation ol Christ to the Samariten wo·
man, that her natiou undull others worshipped they knew not

origin, as if they heard the very words pronouneed by God
himself. The subject, indeed, merits a diffuse discussion, and
a most accurate examination. But the reader will pardon me,
