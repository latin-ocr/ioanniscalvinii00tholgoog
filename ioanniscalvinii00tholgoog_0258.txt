Christiane, they nave made them to be counsels which we are
at liberty to obey or not to obey, and have confined the neces·
sary observance of thern to the monks, who, on account os this
very circumstance, would be more righteous than plain Chris-
tiane, because they voluntarily bound themselves to observo
these counsels. The reason which they assign sor not receiv-
ing them as laws, is, that they appear too burdensome and
grievous, especially to Christians who are under the law of
grace. Do they presume in this manner to disannul the eternal
law os God respecting the love of our neighbour? Is sucha
distinction to be found in any page of the law? On the con-
trary, does it not abound with commandments most strictly en-
joining the love os our enemies? For what is the meaning os
the injunction to seed our neighbour when he is hungry?(b)
to direct into the right way his oxen or his asses when they
are going astray, and to help thern when sinking under a bur-
den? (c) Shall we do good to his cattle for his sake, and feel
no benevolence to his person? What! is not the word of the
Lord ctcmal? “ Vengeance is mine, I will repay : '’ (d) which
is expressed in another passage still more explicitly: “Thou
shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of
thy people.’' (e) Let them either obliterate these passages from
the law, or acknowledge that the Lord was a Legislator, and
no longer salsely pretend that he was only a counsellor.

LVII. And what isthe meaning os the following expressions,
which they have presumed to abuse by the absurdity of their
commenti “ Love your enemies, bless them that curse you,
do good to them that hate you, and pray sor them which de·
spitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye may be the
children of your Father which is in heaven.''(f) Here, who
would not argue with Chrysostom, that the allegation os such
a necessary cause clearly proves these to be, not exhortations,
but commandments? What have we left us, aster being ex-
punged from the number of the children os God? But accord-

ing to them, the monks will be the only sons of the heavenly .

Father3 they alone will venture to invoke God as their Father.
What will now become os the Ohurch? Upon the same prin-
ciple it will be confined to heathen and publicans. For Christ
says, “ If ye love them which love you, what reward have yei
do not even the publicans the same? '² (g) Shall not we be
ina happy situation, if they leave us the title os Christiane,
but deprive us os the inheritance of the kingdom os heaven?
The argument os Augustine is equally strong. When the

Lord, says he, prohibits adultery, he sorbids you to violate the
