sousness which is superior to the observance of the law. And
it will be of use ιο remember this distinction, because, though
any one could satisfy the law, he could not even then stand
the scnttirry of that righteousness which exceeds all compra-
hension. Thercfore, though Job is conscious of his own in·
tegrity, yet he is mute with astonishment, when he sees that
God could nothe pleased even with the sanctity of angele, if
he were ιο enter into a strict examination of their works. 1
shall, therefore, now pass over that righteousness to which 1
have alludcd, because it is incomprehensible, and content my·
self with asserting, that we must be worse than stupid, if, on
an examination of our lives by the rule of the written law, we
are not tormented with awful dread in consequence of so
many maledictione, which God has designed to arouse us, aud
among the rest this general one ε “ Gursed be he that confirmeth
not all the words of this law to do them.” (a) ln short, this
whole controversy will be uninteresting and useless, unless ·
every one present himself as a criminal before the celestia!
Jndge, and voluntarily prostrate and humble himself in deep
solicitude concerning his absolution.

11. To this point our eyes ought to have been raised, that
we might learn rather to tremble through sear, than to indulge
in vain exultation. lt is easy, indeed, while the comparison is
made only between men, for every man-to imagine himself to
be possessed of something which others ought not to contemn;
but when we ascend to the contemplationes God, that confi·
denee is immediately lost. And the case of our soul with re-
spect to God is similar ιο that of our body with respect to the
visible heavens3 for thc eye, as long as it is employed in be-
holding adjacent objects, receives proofs of its own perspica-
city; but if it be directed towards the sun, dazzled and con-
founded with his overpowering brightness, it feels no less ds·
bility in beholding him, than strength in the view of inferior ob·
jects. Let us not, then, deceive ourselves with avain confidance,
although we consider ourselves equal or superior to other men.
'I'hat is nothing to God, to whose decision this cause must be
submitted. But is our insolence cannot be restrained by these
admonitions, he will reply ιο usin the language which he
addressed to the Pharisees: “ Ye are they which justify your·

selves before men; but that which is highly esteemed among
men, is abomination in th'e sight of God.” (y) Go now, an

among men prondly glory in your righteousness, while the uod
of heaven abominatas it. But what is the language of the
· servants of God, who are truly taught by his Spiritl One
says, “ Enter not into judgment with thy servant, for in thy
sight shall no man living be justified.” (z) And another,
