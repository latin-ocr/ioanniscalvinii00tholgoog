they have removed, in appointiug, by an inviolable law, that
very thing which the former punished with excommunicatum
and the latter gave a powerful raason for disapproving. Thera
was a father (g) who asserted the temerity oi deciding on either
side os an obscure subject, without clear and evident testimonias
os Scriptura. This landmark they forgot when they made so
many constitutions, canons, and judicial determinations, with-
out any authority r'rom the word of God There was a sa·
ther (h) who upbraided Montanus with having, among other
heresies, been the firstimposer oi lawe for the observante of
fasta. 'I’hey have gone iar beyond this laudmark also, in es·
tablishing fasta by the strictest laws. There was a father (i)
who denied that marriage ought to be forbidden to the minis·
tarsos the Church‚ and pronouuoed cohabitation with a wife to
be real chastity3 and there were-fathers who assented to his
judgmont. They have transgressori these landmarks by en· '
joining on their priests the strictest celibacy. There was a la·
ther who thought that attention should be paid to Christ only,
os whom it is said, “ Hear ye him,'' and that no regard should
be had to what others before us have either said 'or done, only
to what has been commanded by Christ, who is praeminent
over all. This landmarlr they neither prescribe to themselves,
nor permit to be observed by others, when they set up over
themselves and others any masters rather than Christ. There
was a father (lc) who contended that the Church ought not to
take the precedence of Christ, because his judgment is always
according to truth; but ecclesiastioal judges, like other men,
may generally be deceived. Breaking down this landmark
also, they scruple not to essert, that all the authority os the
Scriptura depende on the decision of the Church. All the fa·
thers, with one heart and voice, have declared it execrable
and detestable for the holy word of God to be contaminated
with the subtleties os sophista, and perplexed by the wrangles
os logicians. Do they confine themselves within these land·
marks, when the whole business os their lives isto involve the
simplicity of the Scripture in endless controversias, and worse
