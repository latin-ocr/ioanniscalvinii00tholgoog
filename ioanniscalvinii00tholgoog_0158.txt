choice of each individual, bnt that it is grace which produces
both the choice and the will in the heart; so that every subse·
quent good work is the fruit and effectos it, and that it is
obeyed by no other will but that which it has produced. For
this is his language also in another place -that it is grace alone
which performs every good work in ns.

XIV. When he observes that the will is not taken away by
grace, but only changed from a bad one into a good one, and
when ir is good, assisted3 he only intends that man is not
drawn in such a manner as to be carried away by an external
impulse, without any inclination os his mind; bnt that he is
internally so disposed as to obey from his very heart. That
grace is specially and gratuitonsly given to the elect, he main-
tains in an epistle to Bonisace, in the following language:
“We know that the grace os God is not given to all men; and
that to them to whom it is given, it is given neither according
to the merite os works, nor according to the merits of will, but
by gratuitous sav0u13 and to those to whom it is not given, we
know that it is not given by the righteous judgment os God.''
And in the same epistle, he strenuously combats that opinion,
which supposes that subsequent grace is given to the merite of
men, because by not rejecting the first grace they shewed
themselves worthy of it. For he wishes Pelagius to allow
that grace is necessary to us for every one of our actions, and
is not a retribution os our works, that it may be acknowledged
to be pure grace. But the subject cannot be comprised in a
more concise summary than in the eighth chapter of his treatise
addressed to Valentine; where he toaches, that the human will
obtains, not grace by liberty, but liberty by graee3 that being
{lenti sllptlntltfntlllstltttzlnn tllltlhl
ble fortitude ; that while grace reigns‚ it never falls, but, de·
serted by grace, falls immediately3 that by the gratuitous
mercy of the Lord, it is converted to what is good, and, being
converted, perseveres in it; that the first directiones the hu·
man will to that which is good, and its subseqnent constancy,
depend solely on the will of God, and not on any merit of
man. Thus there is left to man such a free will, if we ohoose
to give it that appellation, as he describes in ,another place, that
he can neither be converted to God nor continue in God but
by grace ; and that all the ability which he has is derived from
grace.
