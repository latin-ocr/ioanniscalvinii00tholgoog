ARGUMENT.

Tun lirst book treats os the knowledge of God the Creator3 but, this
being chietly rnanisestcd in the creation ol nran, nran also is made
the subject ol discussion. Thus the principal topics os the whole
treatise are two-the knowledge ofGod, and the knowledge oi man.
ln the first chapter, they are considered together; in the following
chapters, separately3 yct some things are introduced, which nray he
referred to either or both. What respects the Scripture and images
rnay belong to the knowledge ol‘ God3 what respects the formation
ol the world, the holy angela, and the devils, to the knowledge os
man; and what respects the manner in which God governs the
world, to both.

On the first os these topics, the knowledge of God, this book shows,

First, What kind os knowledge God himselfrequires-Chap. 11.

Secondly, Where it must be sought-Chap. 111.-1x., as follows:

l. Not iu man ; because, though the human mind is naturally
endued with it, yet it is extinguished, partly by ignorance,
partly by wickedness-Chap. ΙΙΙ. IV.

2. Nor iu the structure ol‘ the world; because, though it
shines there with the brightest evidence, testimonies os
that kind, however plain, are, through our stupidity,
wholly useless to us-Chap. V.

3. But in the scripture—Chap. v1.-1x.
