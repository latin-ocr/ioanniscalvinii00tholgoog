the Divina mercy, were constantly careful to exhibit to view
that kingdom 01 David, from which redemption and eternal
salvatiou were to proceed. Thus lsaiah: “l will make an
everlasting covenant with you, even the sure meroies 01 David.
Behold,l have given him for a witness to the people ς ” (0)
because in desperate circumstances the faithful could have no
hope, any otherwise than by 1110 interposition as a witness,
that God would be merciful to them. Thus also Jeremiah‚ 10
comfort them who were 111 despair, says, “Behold, the days
come, saith the Lord, that 1 will raise unto David a righteous
Branch. In his days Judah shall be saved, and lsrael shall
dwell safely.” (10) And Ezekiel: “l will set up one Shep-
herd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant
David. And I the Lord will be their God, and my servant
Davida prince among them; and I will make with thema
covenant 01 peace.”(r) Again, in another place, having
treated 01 their incredible renovation, he says, “David my
servant shall be king over them3 and they all shall have one
Shepherd. Moreover 1 will make a covenant 01 peace with
them, it shall bean everlasting covenant with them.’' (y) 1
select a few passages out 01 many, because 1 only wish to
apprize the reader, that the hope of the pious has never been
placed any where but in Christ. All the other Propheta also
uniformly speak the same language. As Hosea: “ Thea shall
the children 01 Judah and the children 01 lsrael be gathered
together, and appoint themselves 0110 head.’' (z) And in a
subsequent chapter he is still more explicit: “ 'I'he children
of 101001 shall return, and seek the Lord their God, and David
their king.''(c) Micah 0100, discoursing on the return 01 the
people, expressly declares, “their king shall pass before them,
and the Lord 011 the head of them.’' (b) Thus Amos, intend-
mg to predict the restoration 01 the people, says, “ln that day
11111100 up the tabernaclo of David that is fallen, and close
up the breaches thereos ; and Ι will raise np his ruins.''(c)
'I'his implies that the only standard 01 0011011011 was the res·
toration 01 the regal dignity in the family 01 David, which was
accomplished in Christ. Zachariah, therefore, living nearer to
the time 01 the manifestation of Christ, more openly exclaims,
“ Rejoice greatly, Ο daughter of Zion; shout, Ο daughter of
Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just,
and having salvatiou.” (d) 'l'his correspondet with a passage
from a psalm, already cited: “ The Lord is the saving strength
01 his anointed. Save thy people;'’(e) where salvation is
extended from the head to the whole body.
