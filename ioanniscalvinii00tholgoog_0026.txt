no person vill find nny difficulty in determining vvhnt ought
to be the principnl objects of his reseereh in the Scripturc, and
to what end he ought to refer nny thing it contains. This
wey, therefore, being prepared, if I should herenfter publish

' nny expositione of theScripture,1 shall heve no need to in·

troduce long discussions respecting doctrines, or digressione on
common topice, and therefore shall always compress them
vvithin a nnrrovv compess. This will relieve the pious render ⁸
from great trouble end tediousness, provided he come previous·
ly furnished vvith the necessary information, by a knowledge
of the present work. But as the reason of this design is very
evident in my numerous Commentories,1vvould rather heve
it known from the fect itself, than from my declaration.
Ferewell, friendly reader; end if you receive any benedt

from my labours, let me have the assistance of your prayers
with God our Fether.
